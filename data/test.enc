Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
She's not a...
You know Chastity?
But
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
do you listen to this crap?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
It's more
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Where've you been?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
But
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Let go!
I just wanted --
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
Get out!
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You need money to take a girl out
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
You hate me don't you?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
This is so patronizing.
You don't care if I die
Like you could find one
Why'd you let him get to you?
Who?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
So what did I have an effect on ?
So what's your excuse?
You up for it?
State trooper?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
Answer the question, Patrick
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Why can't we agree on this?
As a parent, that's my right
Was that your sister?
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What just happened?
He's the devil's child...
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I want to go with you!
I have to explore the mainland.
What does he say?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
You defend yourself admirably...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
How did you manage it?
How can you be so certain?
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
All of them!  Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
What are you saying?
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I suppose we're both old men now.
The ocean is uncrossable?
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
What do you read?
You bloody...
You tell that to them!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
... Into a monk...
I'm coming with you.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Now I become custody of police department?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
You better get packed.
What are you doing?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
No!  Nothing happened.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Any I.D.?
Only one guys checked in?
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
What would you call her?
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I kill someone famous.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright.
Hey, honey.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Yeah.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
How old are your kids?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Any chance we can do that again?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Did you hear what I said?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
How you erase this?
What is that?
Let me get a shot of it.
I'm serious.
Traitor!!
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
We spent it!
I can get you a job.
Yes, the money is good.
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
Well, he...
I speak English.
A cheap hotel.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
I'll take him.
I'll send a cop back for you.
How did you start the fire this time?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
Okay. 
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Hal?
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.

When are you coming home?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
And your charming little daughter?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
I see.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
That's true.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Pay money?
I never paid for it in my life.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
I'm candy...
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
You here to write my life story?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Yeah.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Well?
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Hey, you wanna bet?
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
Let's go.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
They saved your ass, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
It's late, they're closing...
You okay?
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
What the bell happened?
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
That's what you say, Cates...
Billy Bear...
I got to wait for a call.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Call me later.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Stall.
How hot are they?
When?
How you doing, man?
You sure?
What're you laughing about?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...would you like a drink?
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Who are you?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
What's she doing?
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
They really made her...
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Leeloo... is... she's...
I don't have time... I need to know.
At least, the cat comes back.
I just found a picture of you.
Uh... at least fifty.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Eto Akta Gamat!
...What's your name?
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Other than that... You all right?
Yeah?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Dinoine chagantakat!
Apipoulai!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Here we go again...
Where you going?
You're nothing but a... a...
I'm so very sad.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
At least I won lunch.
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
It's not?
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
This thing solid?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Drink!
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
I'm not accusing you...
I love you.
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What happened to you?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
You should have.
You're killing me...
What?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
A fellow investor.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
What?
Don't ask questions.
I want his name.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
You got absolute zero.
Do it.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
How long you been working there?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
What's next?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Pittsburgh?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
You don't have any other choice.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
You told me to look, so I looked.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
How... how can you say that to me...?
Okay, I'll take it all.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't go back to sleep again.
Kristen, what happened?
You've been up all night?
No...
How long have you been awake?
Not really.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
I don't get it.
So?
Been up with Alice.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Where is he?
What do you mean?
The tickets.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
Very funny.
You disappointed in me?
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
What?
You do good work, Alice.
He sure loves to stay awake.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I've got to write some of this down.
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Who's Jacob?
They think I'm nuts.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
You, too?
You could train someone else.
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Course and speed?
Now they feel it...down below.
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
All ready?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Right <u>at</u> him?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
That's a <u>face</u>???
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Yes.
You heard the news.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
I'm okay.
I used to play ball.
This way.
No brag. Just fact.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Why do they do that?
Yeah. It's stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Was it funny?
But it's not funny now.
What then?
It's fun.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
Jesus, why?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
What do you want, then?
That's illegal, you know.
Huh?
What's the hurry?
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
How you holding up, Wade?
You? Why?
I won't. You interested?
You and Mel Gordon?
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Good. Who?
How's she doing?
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Strange.
Of course! I would've heard.
This is nuts.
What happened?
It makes me sad.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Who are you?
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Just do it.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Call it what you want.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Rolfe.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
The night before the shooting.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Get some sleep.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
What about Margie?
Find them everywhere. 
Which is?
Then who shot him?
I don't know. You tell me.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
It's cut.
Got it.
How we doing, Colonel?
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
My husband is a very courageous man.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
I miss you. And I miss her.
I don't know why you stayed.
What are you doing?
who can I say is calling?
Other way around, sir.
You give me ulcers.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
What?
Forget it.  I was reading.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Dunn.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Elaine.
Elaine, what happened to us?
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Are you afraid?
Now!
Ted, the lever!
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
Can I hold him?
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Do you want to talk about it.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Surely you can't be serious.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
George Zipp said that?
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
See them, Elaine?
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
I like my horizons narrow.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
You don't have squat.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
Kill them both.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
What's this?  What's going on?
Get the picture?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Screw you.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
I believe he is probably lying.
Was.  Divorced.
I'm going home.
Well, let's roll, George.
Please, I must get out here.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
What was that about?
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
Uh, George...
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
But there's no more drug.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
You think this is the guy who did it?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Get outta there!
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Can't lock up...
And it's too late to shut it down?
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
What's the question?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Let's get the fuck out of here!
The corner!  Ready?
Well you're not reading it right!
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
They're in the approach corridor.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
Looks like it stung him.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
They cut the power.
Fifteen meters.
So what do I tell this guy?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Cross my heart.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Gone.
Look, I told you...
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Where?
What's that?
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
And how will you make him keep it?
Humiliated?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Where?
Stop it!
Where?
Why not?
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Wolfi!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
Why not?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Give me one reason I can understand.
Why not?
Go back to bed.
Originals?
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
I see that you're expecting.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Hey!
Really?
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
A-flat, Majesty.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Sire.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Oh, thank you.
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Yes, where?
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
What do you mean, Sire?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Yes, what about him?
It couldn't be better.
Pupils?
What's that?
Father -
Not that I've seen.
Where?
Is he working?
Opera? Opera!
What did he say? What did he say?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
How fortunate.
I have come to commission work from you.
A Mass for the dead.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
How long will you give me?
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
No, please.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
What?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Confutatis Maledictis.
The Fire.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you have it?
You mean in Turkey?
Exactly. A dance.
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
What do you want?
So?
Leave me alone.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Where?
I can't say I do. What is it?
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
But not his body.
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
That lady is back, sir.
What does he want?
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
How did he look?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Yes.
Yes.
And what else?
It wasn't a lunatic.
It was a wolf.
Mr. Kessler?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Aw come on, Alex!
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
How old are you?
That's easy enough.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
I'm a werewolf.
Anything.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
I've left those pills for you.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
How are we feeling tonight?
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
I think he's a Jew.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Some, everyone does.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Go on, ask them.
Say, David...
Could be a lot of things.
It's moving.
See anything?
Jack?
Where are we going?
Nice to see you.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Jack, are you really dead?
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Because this must be stopped.
Do you have any hot soup?
Hello, Tom.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Let me have ten bucks?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
Whose death?
I remember once when your account checked.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I—
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
No.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
What's this?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Helen!
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Mr. Dickson?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
You haven't got a uniform?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
No.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
They must have turned him down.
What did you find out, Mike?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Everybody in?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
We got a problem here, brother?
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
How'd they --
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
The Army can hang him.
But if we take their money and supplies...
Beg pardon?
He's planning a job.
What you sayin' boy?
You shut up now, boy.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
The James-Younger Gang.
What are you saying?
Fine. We hit this bank.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
What the --
The safe. Now.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
What the --
What do you say, sir?
Distracting enough for you?
Web's dead.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
That just might work.
How'd it go in there?
We're doing this for Ma.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Ma! Please!
Riders --
Jesse, are you awake?
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Let the law --
I beg your pardon?
Let me see that.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Tennessee?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Just perfect.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
You wouldn't have done that?
I want them arrested and hanged!
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Are we here?
Luis is a despicable twit.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
Nothing like last time, promise.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Why don t you just go for Price?
I want a firm commitment.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
You're inhuman.
But where?
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Doesn't he live here?
Carnes? Wait.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
It looks so soft.
That's Paul Owen.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
After six.
Patrick?
Yes, Patrick?
Jean?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Want a bite?
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Interesting.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Forget it.
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Just...say...no!
Welt...it depends, why?
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Coffee?
Understandable.  Lime?
So was I.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Have you consulted a psychic?
That's so typical, isn't it?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
He does? You're sure?
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
I lost my job...
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Listen, what's your name?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
I'm just screwed.
You don't wanna move, do you?
It's important.
...But?
That took some fun out of --
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
That'll be a test, won't it?
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
My goodness.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
Will I get to work for Outpost?
What?!
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
Who's that?
...Hello?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
How's it going?
You did this -- overnight?
You really wrote this just today?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
I heard what happened.
Did you?
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
That's great! Thanks.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
Gary, I --
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Ready for number three?
Gary?
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Just thought his work should go on.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Did I say something?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
...Milo?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
Thank God.
Does he know you know?
Meet me at the other location.
Latitude 47 degrees.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
So how'd you like the house?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Who're these guys?
You seem surprised to see me.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Yes.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Thank you.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Thank you, Basil.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
Be careful.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
I hate having my picture taken.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Oh, yes you are.
No, did you use a condom?
Not in the Nineties.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
What do we do now?
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
I have something to tell you.
Kiss me.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
We've got a lot of work to do.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
What is it now?
An evil vet?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
In due time.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
Really?
... death ...
Nature ...
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
I resign.
Of course. I planned that, too.
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Much better.
Do you?
But why? What's the point?
I wasn't about to.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
I must say, you look more your old self --
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Steed ... !
Was I?
To kill me?
Because you always obey orders ...
Yes ... ?
But you did suspect me.
No, after you.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
Aren't you coming?
Mrs. Peel?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Why?
This man -- did you see him?
In your operation.
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
No, please! I beg you ...
John Steed.
You said ... one shot.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Does Cole know about this?
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
That's what we're going to find out...
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Man, you're losing your audience.
All right!
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm ready to make you another deal.
I love that car.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Huh? Wha...
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Let's go.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
I hope Ilene's all right.
It's true.
Hookers beat you up?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
You want to share it?
I just want to be alone.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
You okay?
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Ed... you're kinky!
Where the hell is he?
What's the matter?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Under the table!
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Reach out and snort someone.
Debbie.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
You're late again, Rick.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
I like what you've done with the place.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
Hey.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
It's okay, Stephen, I --
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
Brian.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Hi.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
I want another shot, Sir.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
Then who wrote the report?
Did I say thanks?
Brian?
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Aren't you even curious?
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Fireman shit?
You want some coffee?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
You don't know him.
Nobody cares, Ronald.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
Got a cause?
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
Don't you have any leads at all?
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
People.
Yeah.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
So what are you doing here?
I forgive you.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
I want 15 on the Mets.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
What's that?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
No offense.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
I won't do it anymore.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
That's a great handle.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
I love you too, Daddy.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
You lost me.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Hello.
You okay?
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
You've said that already.
Who's side are you on?
What is this?
Thanks.
Is that good or bad?
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
So they can be on TV.
Peerless, your father called.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
How did you get this gig?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Not her, the one with the little...
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...then what about...
...perfect...
...like macaroni and cheese...
I fell out of my bed last night.
I slept too near where I fell out.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
So what's up with you?
The good stuff.
What else?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Maybe you need to start.
You're sure this is a good idea.
And?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
What is the service, sir?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
All Europe shall hear of this!
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
Then you yield to me.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
How so?
To make me wretched in two weeks.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Will we always leave it at this?
But you refused me, Dorothy.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
By name only.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Was he cheated?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
May I be quite frank with you?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Yes, he's fine.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Can I at least have a drink?
Bill Styles...
I don't want to go --
What about Pike?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
You too?
You did Basic here?
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
And he'd been shot.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
We don't need the tapes --
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Where's the cabin?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
So you killed him?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Where have you been, Jay?
Why?
Full clip to the body --
His chest was hamburger --
I... I don't know...
Why did he come back for you?
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Dunbar will testify that you were.
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
What I said before --
You think you could explain all this to me?
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
You made me look like an idiot --
You're kidding.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
What?
Four --
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
This isn't the time --
Your phone number?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Thank God...
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You think he did it?
You want Kendall, don't you?
What happens to Dunbar now?
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Bloom like a flower?
You were expecting me?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
You won't find a better place!
Then do it.
Bloom!
How old are you?
Promise me you'll come back.
So I've heard.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
Did I ever tell you about how...
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Let's get out of here.
Where are we headed?
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
I'm sorry.
Wait! I need those!
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
Were you and my father having an affair?
I'm going to check on him.
It's bad.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
How did you get here?
How is he?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
It's enough isn't it?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
What did he say?
I need to know who you are first please.
Yes. I know.
And...
Hold on.
So?
What was that?
So how long will you be in England?
Binoculars.
Tell me.
What did he say? Tell me!
He wants a lot of money.
Just leave her alone.
Is that everything?
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Syevodnya?
"Frenzy".
They go. John. They go.
In the world.
In every sense. If at all possible.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Give me some money.
So uh...
No.
We'll pretend it never happened.
And who says what is wrong.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Some... What does that mean?
I got what I paid for.
You don't understand me.
You are throwing me out.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
I wasn't saying anything.
What?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
It's not mine.
Is the flight full?
What are you doing?
Then start taking them seriously.
I need to uh...
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
Still need a lift?
Holy shit.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
I deserve better than this.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Like a man.
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Let me say somethin' first...
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
LET ME GO!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
You take it straight?
Still makin' jokes?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Where you gonna be?
Sorry.
I know that.
How a girl get like that?
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
I skipped lunch.
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
I think she got to you, pappy.
What's this?
Back-up.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
What are you doing?
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
This the right place?
Getting very weird.
Are you expecting anyone?
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
Yakuza.
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
What's in the box?
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
You did great, Ichiro.
How many men?
Joyce?
Thank you.  You have one?
You all right?
Where's the wife?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Dope?
One guy do all the damage?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
Why tell me this?
You trust me?
If I say no?
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
Let's go while there is still time.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
And what can he do for you?
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
No.
When?
You got a machine on it yet?
I was just about to have my dinner.
Yeah.
Well, when do you get paid?
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
But I would like to buy you drink.
You want to see my friends?
You like to kiss her goodbye.
I like you.
How old am I?
But you haven't put in for emigration.
Taffey Lewis?
Yeah?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
The best.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
I'd take him to the doctor.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
Where is he?
How are you doing?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
May I ask a personal question?
But in your profession that is a risk.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
What?
Know what a turtle is?
Same thing.
You look... better.
Methuselah Syndrome.
What makes you think so?
Hi!
You're kidding!
Your mom was a dancer?
My office.
Let's go talk first, Adam.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
How do you do?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Please excuse this interruption.
What's wrong with you?
So far?
Right.
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Wait!  Wait!
Over this?
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
What?
Why not go to work for me?
This is for me.
Because I want to get married.
Could we talk about that a little later?
I was wrong!!
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
That's ridiculous.
You wanted to see me!
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
I don't blame you!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Uh-huh. Adam?
No.
A card?
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
These are wonderful.
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
But, I don't understand.
You're sure?
You have very nice ceilings.
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
This must be very new.
No.
Not on him.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Good-bye, Adam.
How old are you?
What?  What is it?!
The sky?  Where?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Sure.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
Right.
This is your bedroom?
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
All back East.
It's time.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Home sweet home!
What's that noise?
The locks?
To go up.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Oh, no.
Why?
Let's eat our cake.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
I want him to at least see the sky!
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
I forgot some of my stuff.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Alright, I will.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
That water's freezing!
Um... Eve?
What's it to you?!
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
What?!!
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
We came back to the house!
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
To your health, Frank.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
What do you want from me?
You can hit me, if you want to.
I made it go down the toilet.
No.
No. What is happening?
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Yes.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
I want you to hurt me.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
I asked first.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
Dorothy. No!
Hold me, Don.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
He's comin' back? What for?
Hello, daddy.
Who's this fuck?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Can I feel 'em?
Hello?
I don't want to go.
Heineken.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Well. Okay.
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Are you feeling okay?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
What happened to him?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Yes. I do.
That sounds good.
Yeah, but.
OK.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
Did you see her undressed?
Can I give you a kiss good night?
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
You worry about me really?
Everything okay?
What was that all about?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Up where?
Fuck you.
Hey, I just...
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
Are ya ready?
Yes sir.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
What?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
They got nothing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
No ma! No!
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
We're alive.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
Absolutely not.
Destroy all that which is evil...
Is that right, Rambo?
Oh, we're good man.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
He isn't to be touched.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
What?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
Right now.
No. You sure you're okay?
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Hello? You there?
Yes.
Forgive me father.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Just be natural, goddamit.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Where's the manager?
There's another stocker, right?
Is that the manager?
What's wrong with him?
Can I get that credit card from you?
Why not?
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
What the fuck is going on here?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
She's from Cuba.
Obviously. That's a given.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
He went back for his brother.
Where was I?
He told you and you let him do it.
I have an idea for that.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
I think we better go home.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
When'd you get back?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
What do you think?
He doesn't want to fight.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
What?
What are you talking about?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
You're living on a sailboat?
No. I'm not.
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
You mean a safecracker?
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Are you afraid?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Could you grow cinnamon?
See you.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
How long are they going to hold him?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Were you born in Mexico?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Is that him?
Yeah.
Wait. Did he see us?
OK, Bob.
What did I say?
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Where'd she go?
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
What are you doing?
This is natural.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
Is he chasing us?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Just get in the car, Bob.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Come on in. What you been up to?
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Come on!
I'm sorry, Bob.
Everything OK?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Is he in?
Join the party, fellas.
What's the story?
He left his sweater.
Where is he? Where is Rob?
You like Chicanos?
I don't know.
No. Just pool.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Why not? It was just money.
Sir...
She say what time I should call?
Who else knows about this?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
That's not what happened to your parents.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
Because you're afraid!
I have to go now.
You still should've moved.
What do you want?
Who sent you to Greece?
Pamela Landy?
I'll get the book.
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
It's just a nightmare.
That's crazy.
Where --
-- where's left to go? --
-- it's just him? --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I did.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
See that tram coming around the corner?
You hear me? I believed you.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
Abbott?
So when was I here?
That's a lie!
Where am I?
Oh, shit...
Don't need it. I remember everything.
We need to get in there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Good luck.
Believed what?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
What are they doing?
But... what will you do?
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
Peace?!
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
When will his trial be?
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Three, maybe more!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
You've been here before?
I'm not just saying it!
I'm dreaming.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
Why did you?
You have... you have a husband.
We can't stop!
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Come, it'll help you sleep.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
We're gonna be late again.
Darn it!
I... I blacked out.
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
You're. Acting. Like your father.
How. Did you. Know that?
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Books?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Ouch.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Not if you remember my dad.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Are you okay?
Because you're... different.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
I just thought you should know.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
I don't get it.
And...?
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
It didn't feel like a dream.
Can... can... Can I have this?
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
What?
Destroy it?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Just get out, didja?
Lenny? Come on!
Shut up, Tommy!
Here you go, buddy.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
How long have you been married?
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
I see.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Here's to you, sir.
Er, goodbye, sir.
You haven't heard my offer.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Do you know where they are?
Rick?
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
A franc for your thoughts.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Strange. I know so very little about you.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
But why my name, Richard?
When will he be back?
I must find out what Berger knows.
Goodnight.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Ask me?
Ilsa, I --
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
And I congratulate you.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Good evening.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
Well, this might come in handy.
Had a close one, eh?
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
But we made a deal.
No, Captain, please.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I believe you have a message for him?
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
You will give us the names?
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
Ho, diplomatist!
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
It was a combination of all three.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
This is the end of the chase.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Are my eyes really brown?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Get me the Radio Tower!
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
Save some for tomorrow.
No more water, you said.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
You know what happened to this?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Merry Christmas eve.
He is a cute thing.
I have to.
I would never --
If I'd known you were alive --
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
This is so unfair.
Which I didn't have.
If you say you are.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
But chickens?
Really?
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
For the third time.
You are one sick fucker.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
Hello?
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
Hello.
That's all there is.
Thanks.  For everything.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
I mean your parents.
And that I can drive a truck!
So, Mrs...
How many months are you?
I've never seen a lobster.
Where's Mandalay?
Oh...
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
I better go.
People watched the movies in their cars?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
You don't miss it?
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
There! You said it was boring.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
I thought they might take me.
That's true.
That's a heavy sedation.
What's a nanny do?
What's an immigrant?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
They're migrants.
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
I'm stayin', Homer.
First pregnancy?
Where's the name sheet?
I thought it was my turn.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
What's that?
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
They told me I was too old to serve.
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
So, what do you do?
Can --
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
She had you tempting fate.
Who's that?
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
You'll be there?
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Why?
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Excuse me?
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Attractive girl.
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
No.  What's my cut?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
You need to get a haircut.
And some new clothes.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
How do you deal with --
Sorry. I didn't know...
Tick-tock...
Yeah.
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
Why?
Uh...
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Is it all fugasi?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
King ain't gonna like this.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Speak.
You guys awake?
Who?
Peace of mind.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
I'm Bella.
I'll take you up on that.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
How's that football story corning along?
I couldn't resist them.
Where did you get it?
I want to hear it.
It came my way. 450 a week.
Are you drunk?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
Yes, I know that.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
What happened?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I owe a lot of money.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
And I thought you were only after my body.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
I want you to forget what I said.
I'm sorry.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
Yes.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
And your hand too.
I don't think we should meet again.
Hello...
Ross.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
Why four? And not three or five?
What makes you so sure?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
Girlfriend?
That hair will have to go.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
What's he doin'?
The key!
We've got to disarm the bomb.
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Rechannel all safety relays --
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
It is intuitively obvious.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
So if you detonate in...
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- open circuit breakers --
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
I need a diameter approximation.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
What happened, Doolittle?
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
Oh yeah?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
That's correct, sir.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Sir?
Who are you?
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
What?
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Lemme put some clothes on.
But I'm afraid of--
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Where'd you clip this?
Same old story.  Not interested.
What're you looking for?
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
What else can we do?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
Thank God.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Lemme get my coat.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
Bent.
How do I know you didn't?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
With your help.
But she does work here?
How do I know you're telling the truth?
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Morning, Sunshine...
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Yeah.
A little what?
Unlikely.
Only one I can think of.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Catch you back at the wall.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
A toy?
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
Okay, okay, okay--
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
What the hell is that?
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Pick a song, Hawk.
No problem.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
Sunday, but...
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Could be.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
What?!
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
I did it! I did it! We won!
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
But we took the keys?
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
I don't even think you have a gun!
Is that your final answer?
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Are you AFRAID?
What happened?
What was his name?
Theoretically.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Beg pardon?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
Dea ex machina...
Why did you make me flood the school?
You have a request?
What happened to your eye?
Why do they call you Frank?
Hey...
Don't look so freaked.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Donnie?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Will you please talk to me?
Hey.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
People aren't that simple.
Grandma Death.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Oh, shit!
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Cellar door.
His name is Frank.
Don't you watch the news?
Follow him where?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
A sign from whom?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
That I did it again.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Because I'm so horny.
Then how is time travel possible?
When will this happen?
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Gerald.
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
Christ. Is that an axe?
How did this happen?
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
Chut up!
There's no rule!
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
I gotta work with these women.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
I'm gonna need more caps.
Mom!
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
Bye mom.
I hate her!
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
Hi...
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Dakota.
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
Oh! What is it?
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
What's the matter with you?
What kind of a dog is he?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
Send in the next girl. 
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
How'm I doing, boss?
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
Are you getting tired?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
That's what you think.
Give me that again!
Was it -- swine?
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Oh, won't you reconsider...
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
You won't be long?
John loves the house.
Yes.
More romances for John?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
Good morning, Treves.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Oh yes?
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Oh, no.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Of course! You want out?
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
What's this?
...Yyes
Yyess.
Hello...
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
How long will I stay here?
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Ohhh...
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
No, John, not one that I can see.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Watery headed bunch.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Very smart indeed.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
HE'S GONE!
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
WELCOME?
Please! Please! What are those?
What's the matter?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
What was she like?
You're as bad as my father.
Halfdan the Black.
No!
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
No.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
Is there something the matter with it?
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Louder.
Why should you care?
Is THAT Odin?
It's Halfdan the Black!
How deep IS the ocean?
That's terrible!
We're missing all the fun...
You talking piffle, son?
I... I... KILLED her...
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
Slower! In... Out...
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
You mean we'd be dead?
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
A magic dishcloth.
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
What are you talking about, Erik?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Look, I bagged it last week.
Yeah... well...
What's all the panic about?
It can't do you any HARM...
I know. I know.
Let me go, Sven.
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
My brother blacksmiths!
Help!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
KILL! KILL!
Well, go on! Go berserk!
There is nothing we can do...
Thanks, guys.
Yeah, you told me that later.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
And I just liked you so much.
May I help you?
Oh, baby, what's going on?
Come up to Boston with me?
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Really? Because --
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Yeah.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Take care.
Ready for another?
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Tomorrow?
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
Joely...
What if you hide me?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
There's this guy!
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
We did talk about Naomi.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Probably.
You know what I did.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
That's me.
It's them.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
So then she just stops calling.
Okay. I wish you could come.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Stan... c'mon...
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
I know what it is.
Order me a pastrami for after?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
I tried that already.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Yeah?
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
What's your bartlett's?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
But I don't know how to polka.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
A traveler, eh?
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
That's Jellybean!
No, I guess not.
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Whose fault was that?
Thanks.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
But Countess...
Ballast.
I can see why they sent you along.
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
What?
It's holding... She's holding...!
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
I don't know what happened to Justin.
What's happening?
How? The Bridge is gone.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
Do you hear it? Right there.
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Patch me through to him.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
What's the hold up?
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Can anybody hear me...
Peters...
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Yes.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
It is now.  We're locked in.
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
That's an affirmative.
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
You've got to listen...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Weir can't be alive.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
He served on the Goliath.
Claire...
Where is she?
What the hell is that?
The safety circuit's failed!
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
If they are, they're screening their calls.
What is it?
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
Claire is your wife?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Those yours too?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
What about his first born?
Isn't that your speech?
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
How long was I out?
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
What the --!
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Ben --
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Me like-y.
He's not responsive --
This is wrong in so many ways.
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Apparently I can disappear.
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
That's good. That's uh... good.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
I found a broken gasket, from space --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Ben did this?
It's just business.
What are you doing?
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
How much did they cost?
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
I can't find it, mon!
On the ledge?
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Hi, Brad.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
You are a virgin!
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Dad says you have to get up!
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
You're a really good kisser.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Did you get her number?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
I would. Yeah.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Hey, Rat.
Damone, are you there?
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Are you Linda Barrett?
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
Are you going to ride that wave?
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
Seen the new Playboy?
My brother's car!
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
I paid for it and everything.
Not coming? What happened?
Sometime?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
You just ripped my card in two!
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Where do you feel like going?
Are you really nineteen?
Is this your first time?
Thanks for coming to get me.
Are you all right?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
I had a really nice time tonight.
Where's your brother?
...I've got to go home.
What's April 16th?
I made a fool of myself.
Really?
Anything to drink?
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Rum and ice, please.
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Naked!?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
What do you mean by that?
Oh, my God!...
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
What are you talking about?
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
I have to go.
Where'd you get that knife?
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
NO! Stop talking like that.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
No, she's looking for you.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
Where are you two going?
IS IT CLEAR?!
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
So, your husband ditched you?
They're right here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
What tunnel? Where?
Where's the tunnel?
Scared?
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
Come on!
Why do you take shit from him?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
How much you got?
How much you got to see the show?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Open?
How many?
Nine?
Keys.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I wouldn't do that, son.
Got 'cha!
NO, but I will lock you in.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
OH JESUS!
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Hold it!
Oh my God... What is that?
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
We should stick together out there.
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Madam...?
Okay, but come here first.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Who?
A rich actress.
What does Clifford say?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
Harry!
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
It's already started, Dad... with me.
Of course.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I'm going back to the hotel.
Kurt!
I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
What?
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Okay then...
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
How'd I look?
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Serious, huh?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
Don't start, Farmer.
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
Evening, gorgeous.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
Frances! Frances!
I love you, Harry. I love you.
That would be okay.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Yeah.
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
That's me, Clifford.
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
It's okay.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
What?
Mama, shut up!
You're not going anywhere!
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
I don't believe so.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
This whole thing is a joke!
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
Huh?
Symington says...
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
You're an outcast.
Come warm yourself if you like.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Friend?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
And if I consent?
She's beautiful.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Nothing. Still nothing.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Are you all right?
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Father's so proud.
Brother and sister still?
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
No. But someday.
I am not mad.
Are you having me on?
Do you really think I'm mad?
Quite a few.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
They just caught the man who did it.
They'll hang him all the same.
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
How much longer?
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Philosophical?
Paracelsus?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
We should go now.
Melvin Belli.
Cabin B is ready.
You draw very well.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
What'll you do when you leave here?
How the... did he get in there?
I'll go check on Brenda.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
How come?
Claudette...
Let's go back, Barry...
What the hell?
Thanks.
You just had some lucky shots.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Holy shit...
What hath God wrought?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Looks like a storm.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
It's beautiful...
You okay?
How much do I owe you?
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
Twenty-eight.
Why do you want to stop?
Have you forgotten about your sister?
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
She's dead?
Then?
Who else?
You too, preacher?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
I promise.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
I promise.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Are you okay?
-- you got your sink --
-- see this, television!
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
Were you giving that pig signals?
I never said help us!
Do they have an X-rated channel?
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
Where's the woman?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Richard!
This isn't gonna work.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
How?
My shit is together.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Hardly the case, Senator.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
You know him.
Should probably ask him that.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Close as I can get, el-tee!
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
Come on, Montgomery...
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
I'll try anyway, sir.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Just a coincidence?
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
She's haze grey and underway...
So dump on me.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
So why are you telling me this?
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
"In Washington..."
Made it to Week 10 last time.
At first.
Do you, uh, know...
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
She part of the training?
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
32 feet, six inches!
Would you have shot if it was a man?
Got it.
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
I just wonder how that happened.
I take it this file is still open.
Who the hell are all these people?
What?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
What are you doing?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
And you think this creature is one of them?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
You never said it was off the record.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
Can I use some?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
You don't understand, I can get us information...
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
And how should we do that, Sir?
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
What sample?
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Don't speak, Quellek.
You WILL go out there.
At ease men.
We've got to stop!
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Settle down, Alex...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Oh my god, It's real.
We heard it the first time!
He always has to make the big entrance.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
That's It?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
The enemy is matching velocity.
Systems register functional.
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
As good as Hopkins?
How do you remember this stuff?
You Okay, Alex?
...The digital conveyor.
It's suicide.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
Oh, they're so cute.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
...Okay
Your last name.
It's... I don't know.
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
It's Jason...
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Hey... Hey where are you going?
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Can it be repaired?
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
You should have let me hit him.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
What's going on?
Excuse me?
Do your best, Tommy...
Find them.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
What's your frank estimation of the British?
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Is that a fact.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
I hope I never have to believe that.
Well, George, who were you?
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
What?  What are you talking about?
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
Who is that!?
How old are you, Captain?
I'm so inclined.
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
Sir, I think no such thing.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
They are... friends of Congress.
You think that?
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
General Lee is detained captain...
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
Colonel Reed...
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
You must be very rich.
What is it, Marquis?
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
Well, this must be about something!
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
What are you doing?
You hear that?
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
My daughter, I ask only...
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
What is this?
I reserved a Cadillac.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
I guess still in the locker.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
You get life for kidnapping.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
What's this movie you're doing first?
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
Get something going there.
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
You know Laurel Canyon?
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
C-18.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Why would I do that?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Who the fuck are you?
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
You have a card in here?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
That's what I'm doing.
What does that mean?
Ever shot anybody.
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -– this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer –-
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Really.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Yeah, he told me.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Very nice...
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
How? By taking my money?
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
I got you a copy of the script.
I think it's not horrible.
Then you've read it?
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Yeah?
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
I don't know.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
I told you not to -–
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
What's wrong?
Harry -–
Which two?
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Smokes?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Dodge.  Dodge.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
But how long?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
Damn barbaric is what it is.
That'd be my guess.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
What the fuck -- ?
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Could be a fishing boat.
You mean, before she sank.
Coffee.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
You okay?
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Who?
What guy?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
Murphy to Epps.
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
The ah... the radio's out.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
What do you think happened on this boat?
Over the gold.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Pretty low all around.
How're you feeling?
Say what?
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
We're still drifting.
Can't find the shotgun.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
I thought you say Tuesday.
No, no. You got leak.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Hmm.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
So Josh...
That guy rules!
Jesus, look at this guy.
Hi... what's up?
Are you the one who left that note?
What do you mean "why"?
Yeah, right...
Why not?
Okay... I promise.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Hi.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Hi, Al!
I want to do him!
Look, maybe that's him!
I want to "make love" to him.
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
What's he doing now?
Just promise you'll do it.
Where are we going?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
When was this?
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Hello?
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
There.
I dunno...
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
A what?
Hi... what's your name?
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
Five hundred.
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
What about her? Would you go out with her?
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Every guy has a type!
Well are --
Relax, Seymour, relax...
Yes, that would certainly do...
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
Never...
Aren't you going to get that?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
Just someone so young...
I... I don't think so.
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
I hate sports.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
What do you want?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
Yeah, well... me neither...
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Seymour?
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
No hints, Samuel.
I am a man of peace.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
Understand, I had help-
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
...misfire... it jammed...
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
I'll have to.
How many do you think they've killed?
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
For you.
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
What do you want with my baby?
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
I'll do it.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
You're really good, you know.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Does she know anything about babies?
Can I help you?
That's quite a story.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
Egon!
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
I'm Egon --
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Who, Ray?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
I'm Ray --
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
And pure --
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
Aren't you glad we waited?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
You really don't act like a scientist.
Uh-huh.
You're quite a housekeeper.
Damn!
I want to help you.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
He is the Destructor.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
What's that got to do with it?
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
All right.  What is it?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh!  You're here.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
Don't cross the beams.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
What happened??!!!?
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
What is it?
Anything!  Just make contact.
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Do you believe in God?
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
That's what you told me two days ago!
I should at least have you, don't you think?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Where is my father?
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
I've read of it.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
As soon as I can.
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
You brought the army into Rome.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
You need to come home!
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Hello.
Are you going to graduate school?
Is anything wrong?
What is the matter?
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Did they ever find out?
And it's all over now.
I do.
What is it?
Don't cry. 
Where are you meeting this person?
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Is that him over there?
But you're not enrolled.
-- really incredible --
I said I think it is.
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Why?
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
Oh no. He said that.
657-2036
Exactly how do you mean?
You're not one of those agitators?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Could I make one phone call first?
Well here's the purse.
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Benjamin?
Where are you?
What?
Is anything wrong, sir?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Will you take me home?
Thank you.
Aren't you?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
I think I'll go to bed.
Thank you.
What are you so scared of?
Then why do you keep running away?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
I want to say something first.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Do you understand what I said?
May I have a drink?
Yes.
Well -- goodbye then --
Will you bring me a hanger?
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Oh my God.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
What?
What do you say to him?
Always?
We're talking.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Man, is this interesting.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Well I can't.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
And you were a student also.
Do you understand that?
I have my reasons.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Braddock -- Braddock?
Can I talk to you a minute?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I drive around.
Why did you say that?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
When did you two talk this over?
I guess -- about my future.
Have you thought about graduate school?
Say that again.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Thank you very much, sir.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Sir?
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
What's happening?
I don't believe it.
Turn 'em up.
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
I want to speak --
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
I have an idea working in my head... 
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
You?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Going?
You live here?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
What can you see?
No.
And?
And what do you do -- now?
So --
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Very early in the morning.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Bless you...
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
The Baron is tired?
Well -- last night was not so good.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
Is that for me?
And the child isn't coming?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Anyone asked for me?
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
You like music?
A man might what?
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Moreover --
Tired?
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Insolent young cub!
Come here. 
Oh, no.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Madam should sleep.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
He will be on the train.
What is this insolence?
Yes, I know them --
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Pretty as a picture.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
Permanent damage.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Right in front of the room.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Well, uh... No.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
They knocked out my tooth!
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
Don't mention it.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
I tripped over a chair.
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
I just came back from Phoenix.
No.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
At what?
You want a drink?
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
I know what's bugging you, of course.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
For God's sake, Lilly!
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
I didn't teach you that.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Roy? It this all we have?
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
Get well soon.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
He retired.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
What is it? What's going on?
What's that?
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Sure. Let's get it over.
Yes, I know, I know.
What?
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Well, when you put it that way.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Where?
I can be real stiff.
That's it?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
What the --
Where are you going?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
It's an option.
What?  Where is she?
Not me.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
Hey, you alright?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Wait.
I have to pee.
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
He do that to you?
Mom -- Who is this?
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
You've been watching too much TV.
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
Mommy, I'm scared.
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
What now?!
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
What is that?
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Home, sweet home.
Um.
Home.
You know what gets me?
At least we found the diamonds.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I'm liable to find anything!
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
Could have happened to anybody.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Go to the funeral?
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
For Africa.
Gee whiz--
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Anybody home?
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
College!
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Play?
A hundred dollars!
Can I get dressed first?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Mom?
That's a rifle you have?
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Disease?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Please--
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
That's what you're supposed to say.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
And no one's there now?
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
Honor, I suppose.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
You've been bitten by bats?
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Good Lord.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
You're a son of a bitch.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
Hands and knees, you say?
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
You hope.
Was I ever of use?
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
New lives begin!
I dunno, boy.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Who's dead?
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Thank God!
That goes double for me.
He's a ghost!
In a railroad accident many years ago.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
A lot of people don't.
I hate that thing.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
Yes?
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
I'm touched.
The park!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
What was it?
I'm sorry.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
Phooey.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
No. I don't think so.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
You're still dressed?
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
What do you mean?
You want a tip?
Now, what do you want?
That's cool.
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
No.
Where's he?
When do we start?
I thought you were going to bed?
You don't drink?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
Neither am I.
How important do you think sex is?
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
I can stop if you want.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Did you find out where she was?
Andy.
Hello?
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
I don't know.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Yeah. Probably.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
What happened, pilgrim?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
You're talking about real excitement?
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Fifty cents admission.
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
This is from the movie I was talking about.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
What's that?
Com'on, tell me.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
Huh?
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
You can fuck off, too.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Come again.
Took it?
Your tree.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
A block of ice.
Eh, no. Thank you.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
But this is my car.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
Sort of.
All right.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You look as if you could.
What were you fighting for?
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
I like Glaucus.
Well, I really don't smoke.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
Yes.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
It looks like you. Thanks.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Supper for two.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
I feel giddy.
Mother.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
Yes. It does.
Harold?
You liked your teachers?
Your studies?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
The moment of truth.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Well, I didn't.
Frank.
You knew?
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
It's a beautiful dress...
It's coming.
I... I had a visitor.
No bad dreams.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
I... remember.
Steve...
He talked about Demons, huh?
I need to touch it to "see"...
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Don't get psychic with me.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Nah -- he's taken care of.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
That's all for you, Sammy.
hound of resurrection --
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
Here. You'll need one of these.
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
Sir, may I go first??
That voice --
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
What are you trying to say?
Yup.
Thank you.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Myers??? How's your arm?
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Well good n-
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Out? Out out?
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
Strong.
But it's not true, is it?
Just take it slowly.
You fucking ass-holes.
Got her mother's looks.
Oh.
The box... you opened it. We came.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
Just in time.
No.
You bastard --
Bastard.
But you said --
Back from where?
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Well?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
She'll tell them everything...
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Don't you care?
Kirsty.
Kirsty? It's very late.
This afternoon.
How long since you were here?
Why didn't he want to sell it?
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You're still blaming me.
Where are you?
Is it deep?
It's probably going to need stitches.
You know it's not often I... you know...
No, not much.
No personal details?
I suppose not.
First time for everything.
Why don't you do the same?
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Take care, Dad.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Kirsty.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Where are you going?
Need any help?
What do we do if there isn't?
Meaning what?
I beg your pardon?
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
Can I lend you a hand?
Play it.
We'll do it next Monday.
I wanna date a musician...
What?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
Why would they care?
Hey.
Fuck off, Barry.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
Anna Moss.
Where's Rob?
What are you talking about?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
What's this?
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Hi.
Are you coming home?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
You won't like it.
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
So, how are you?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
I'm sure.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Don't forget your CDs.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
I'm sorry.
Do you want me to be there?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
You know, with Ray...
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Mission accomplished.
You know the difference.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
More confident, maybe.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
That way.
I'll call you.
And after that?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
I warned you.
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Do you play?
Byzantine?
He tried to kill me last night.
He was innocent.
Is this what you killed them with?
You did kill those men.
You make it all sound so simple.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
Maybe it would do us both good.
I hope I never get that old.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What's wrong?
What is it?
A murder.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Good way to lose your job.
Who is it?
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Be quiet.
Afternoon.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
It is the truth.
Why?
Impotent cow.
It will take less effort as you learn.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Who am I deceiving?
Not so scared.
Finish your prayers?
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
My father taught me.
Where!
_Answer_ me.
Spare a chair?
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
Friend of yours?
Run!
What's the point?
Tradition.
I want you to come to me.
This your present address?
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
Do you know what this is?
My condolences.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
The resemblance is amazing.
Morning Mr. North
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Who is it?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
How do you mean?
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
But --
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
What's the matter?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Hildy! Where's mother?
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
Anything the matter?
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
How long would the interview take?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Well, she'll know some day.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Hildy!
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
What do you want?
How long is what?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Sure you can. Come on.
What do you mean by that?
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
You can't sell me that, Walter.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Afraid? I should say not!
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
You said it.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Exclusive? That's great.
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
She jumped out of the window.
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Look at me, Hildy --
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Ring that number, will you?
No, you don't! Walter!
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Then why are you doing it?
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
How about Bruce's?
Hildy, darling!
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Walter!
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
Well, that about covers everything.
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Hold the phone!
Goodbye, Yonson.
We know what you're up to.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
After all I've done for you --
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Who is this man?
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
I won't.
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
There goes another scrub lady.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Have you got my dough?
Come on with that money!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Don't forget about production for use.
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
What's the idea?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
They wouldn't take it.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
Only till they get you into the local school.
It's true.
I know a secret.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
Sod.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
You wouldn't.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
You said that last year, Dad.
It was great for me, how was it for you.
Where?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
What about it?
How's your war, Mac?
And what's that?
We don't know anything about it
Why didn't they say that before you started?
You know it? It must be an old one.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
It was the best time of his life.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
Molly!
Cone.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Drink up, it's party time.
What about the tree?
Is your brother ready to go?
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Thank you.
That's not something to joke about.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
The Duke?
No, no I think it's really interesting.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Keep straight on this road here.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Almost there.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Should we stop?
Fine. I'll go straight.
Is that all... think real hard.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
What?
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Yeah?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Don't even say it.
What was that?
A couple hours!
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Well hello, officer.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
I don't know. I only saw one.
What should I do?
Turn up this road.
We gotta break it open.
Tell it to my daughter.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
Plates match.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Over.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
And?
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Shall we close up, then?
What is wrong, my darling?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
I've moved on.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
No.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Progress!
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals. Loves you.
So?
My brother says he likes you, too.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
No. I married a midget.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
How'd you know where I was?
Your brother should have his license revoked.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
I'm sorry?
Boy, this is good!
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I'm sorry about my parents.
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
I don't know. Something.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Who is it?
Who from work?
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
It would just be helpful to know.
Really?
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Bravo to you, Puff!
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
You were gone a long time.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
Oh boy!
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Interesting.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Mother?
Boys just passing through?
Pittsburgh?
Comin' in or goin' out?
About sixty, seventy bucks.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Huh?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
To win.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
Are you ready for another?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Make it twenty.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Character.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Seventy-five per cent.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Well, we won't.
I'll beat him the next game.
Fifty per cent?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
You name it, we shoot it.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Yeah, that's right.
He's my partner.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
HOW MUCH?!
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You better not miss, friend.
What time does the bus leave?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
Hey!
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
I could always get us a bottle.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
What time is it?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
What did all this stuff cost you?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Give it to me.
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
He knows. A lot.
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
You glad?
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
No, I want to walk.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Who is this?
You want to find them.
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
I don't know.
That's who you are too, Emma.
Do you still want me to stay?
Emma...
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
We're going to be moving, son.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
Where's your car?
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
What did he talk to you about?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
Where, Jimmy?
Did you call the State Police?
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
What do you want?
What?
What do you want me to do?
Better be. You left me for him.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Love was never our problem.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
A countdown to what?
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
Pops!
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
What the hell is that?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
Not listed, huh?
Dad, please...
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
Get us out of here!
Nice meeting you.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
And our forces?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Grey, you read me?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
You can't go. Call them back.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Wait. I have to tell you something.
Dick-weed!
You're late.
Dick-weed.
Your son.
Really? Ballet?
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Damn it!
Stop it.
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Mr. President?
Call them back.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Yes.
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
How's the head?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Tapestries?
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
Doctor Jones?
Bingo.
It must be one of these...
At least I let you tag along.
No. You like the way I do things.
All I have to do is squeeze.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
Dad!
But what are you doing here?
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Through the library?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
And the chair.
Stop!
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
What does that mean?
Dad, are we hit?!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
I like Indiana.
Ready?
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Where's my father?
Then we'll die.
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
You understand what he tells us?
What's that?
What you look at, Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
What does it mean, Indy?
Let up on the brake!
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
What do you mean -- how?
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
And then they took their children.
What'd he say now?
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
Can you move your arm?
What's happening?
What about the future?
He's afraid of something.
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
Primitive sexual practices?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
What is it...?
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
It's okay. You're all right now.
I want to go home...
I can't!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
No, not her. Me.
My name is AL.
Try me.
Arrrgh!
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
My place, can't you see?
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
What for?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
You're not crazy.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
What was that?
No they won't.
I'll talk to them.
Behind us?
I wouldn't say that.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
They could put you back in the tube..
Sue them.
Just walk down the hall?
What do we do?
I don't have any.
I can't do that.
I'll get in trouble.
...and a license to kill...
Oh yeah, to what?
It's sand.
Al, are you doing anything in there?
Beautiful!
What do I do?
.
...Joe.
What happened?
Mind your own business.
Follow that busboy.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
She's got the most beautiful...s
Don't you think I stand out like this.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
What next!
What?
He was with Gruner!
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Aim just in front of his face.
Gimme a minute.
What are you doing?
Sorry...
Doesn't matter.
No!
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
I'm against it.
Nice?
We'll have to let them go.
Sir?
Yes?
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
It may have been affected.
You may not remember things.
When you remember...
We're here.
Al?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Oh...and who is it!?
Is someone else here?
I can't do that?
And you?
Promise you what?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
Who do you work for?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Why?
You work for Ryuji?
He didn't.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
I'm leaving too.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
Then why are you smiling like that?
And Dieter.
Where what?
What?
Why'd you ask him.
What happened?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
How?
Now what?
Don't worry.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
You can't take that.
Yes.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
I'll take some.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Yeah.
We gotta hook up.
When's your deadline?
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
When's the air date?
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
Do you want more rice?
What are you cooking?
You're exaggerating!
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
A gun? Yes.
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
Come again?
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Why?
Lowell?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
What's wrong?
What are you and Mike going to do?
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Yeah...
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Alright?
We're there.
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
No shit.
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Oh, man.
Lowell!
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Give me a break!
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
...but that's as far as I go...
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
How much would I get paid?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Next to your father?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Excuse me. Yeah...
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
You attract a crowd.
What's changed?
No? No, what?
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
You greased the rails!
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
What about now?
Most certainly.
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object!
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
You're in a rush.
Objection, your honor!
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
What the hell is Botox?
What?
He's the wrong man.
I'm happy for you, pal.
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
It sounded like a bell.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
These are yours.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Marylin? When did I say...?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Is that you?
We're damaged goods.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
Comfy!
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
I fell in love Miles.
Wait! He works for YOU?
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Murder!
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Hello, Rex.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Forgery and Fraud?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Is this Ming?
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
That's delusional.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
...arty farty!
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Wait... He wants to give her...?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Three is not Farrow.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
Who said anything about a reward!
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
What's this about not eating?
I might.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is—
Where are you taking me?
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Well!
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Why should she? After all—
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
What about that diamond wrist watch she had on—she can raise some money on that?
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
We've done that already.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
I never thought of that.
Here, boy!
Of course I do. What do you mean—
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Do you mind putting out the light?
Who are you?
You've got a name, haven't you?
Here—
High time you got back.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Detectives!
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
It takes money to buy food.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
Peter—
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Here. Eat your head off.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
What are you thinking about?
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Uh-huh. Want one?
You think it's simple, huh?
Here comes a car!
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
I hope you got your money.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited—
—six—seven—eight—nine—
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
But can't you wait until morning—
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
The dame's too smart for him.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
Who's she gonna marry?
I'd put you there myself.
You!
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Funny couple, ain't they?
There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—
Mebbe.
Yeah.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
Right.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Recall any names?
Bill.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Why?  What's wrong?
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Then who killed the President?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
No.
I don't believe it!
Aren't you being a little hard?
I'm sorry.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
Honey, you all right? 
Hi.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
What's wrong, Lou?
I know David - a strange character.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Time?
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Are they?  Why would they?
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Well, thanks for coming.
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
How much more?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
Do you walk home?
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Look, man, I know I owe you --
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Why were you with him?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
You got a good lawyer?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
Help us do what?
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
How was your flight?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
That doesn't sound dark.
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Who is this?
'76?
He told me last night.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
How'd you feel about it?
My ass ain't the same.
I walked right past you.
He was here?
I called you last night.
I see.
Has he hinted around?
You know some interesting people.
What about you Max?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
It'll be more than that.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
In a dress.
He's liable to shoot you.
He's already there.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
I didn't use you, Max.
Where're you going?
He say we like the same thing as married.
I know what it looks like.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
You know what we want.
How can you help us?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
Not really.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
What did you do after that?
There was a guy with Melanie?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
Oh, hi.
Killian's.
How long you been with Ordell?
You think I'm kidding?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
How the fuck they know that?
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Who?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Want a hit?
How long?
What for?
You okay?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Which one?
Were you a disco girl?
With Ordell?
C'mon, don't lie.
Did you ever go I one?
About five years ago.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
We're leaving now!
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Who was Beaumont?
She believed you?
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
Uh-huh.
You shot Melanie?
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
How long was she in there?
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Jesus Christ.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
I'm going out for a few hours.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
How can I help you?
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
It's in my bag.
I need your name and address.
House or apartment?
Comfortable?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
You didn't hear?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
What's up with this shit.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
She's been there since Thursday night.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
She's all alone.
He ain't here right now.
Let me out of here!
It's all been a dream.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Daddy. Let go.
Short? It's ended.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
I am.
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
You think they're connected?
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
Louis, you're a life saver.
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
No.  I see them.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
She was good in bed, though.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
That help?
What happened to you?
Did you look around the headboard?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Yeah, but for what?
She looked good then.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
We're at Della's.
How high is that?
What'd the doctor say?
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
How come? The army?
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
While you were in the shower.
It's just me.
Who else were you expecting?
I want to know. You tell me!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Are you out of your mind?
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
Bullshit!
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Oh God!
WHO ARE YOU?
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
You come here often?
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
I think I'm falling asleep.
I can't move.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Goodbye old friend.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
What's that?
Can we blow it with just two?
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Okay that hurt.
Where the hell were you?!!
Nice touch.
You see that?
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Kay-Em!
How many?
You're a teacher.
What the hell are you doing?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Rizzo, he's out there.
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
We're screwed!
What if you miss?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
Spunky . . .
Yuck.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Push off toward us.
I...I don't know what I did...
Now this is getting exciting.
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
Hurry! She's lost it!
What do we do?!!
I don't know...sorry?
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
I didn't say I was good at it.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Sorry, sorry.
Do I have to?
Kay-Em, you okay?
Kay-Em we made it!
I don't understand...what does he want?
How do you know?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
It's my charter. My party.
That's it! Radio in for help!
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Can you stand something to eat?
Colorful, isn't he?
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
Got a pen on you?
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
What the hell?
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Quint...?
Think the tide's with us?
You picked her up on the ferry.
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Would you like something? Some coffee?
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Well... is everything all right?
20 feet, if it's an inch...
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
What can that gun of yours do?
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Charisma?
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
You're being really immature.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Did you hear it's yours?
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
Wow, dream big!
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
The Wizard of Gore?
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Cool.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Oh, okay. Like this.
No.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
You should try Adderall.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
What?
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Is this Juno?
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
She answered our prayers.
Have you found a place to stay?
A hotel?
No.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
What's this?
You took this picture?
Carryin' a gun.
What?
Happy birthday Adele.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Shush, Adele.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Early, what're you doin'?
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
What's your name, boy?
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
So how's it going?
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Who said he's my good buddy?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
What's that?
There's more...
Bri'.
Early, just think...
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
...Diebold?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Yes. Altogether.
What do you think?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Can you do it man?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
I don't understand why you do that.
Yeah. Why you give money.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
How much you gonna take?
Casper, where's Telly.
Where you goin' tonight?
You sure?
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Sup. Sup.
Hey.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
What do I want to do?
Because your a virgin?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Miss, would I be prying?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
The pain. The fucking pain!
You are being ripped open.
You didn't?
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
I'm coming.
What happened?
Who, Benny's little sister?
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
And you don't get shit out of it.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Yeah?
Yep.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Slow.
Right.
Yeah.
What man? What is it?
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
Morpheus.
Are you crazy?
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
You got it on the board.
Yes you are.
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
What do you think?
Take it easy.  Both of you.
No shit!
Ready for round two?
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
What do you mean, stand out?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Hello?
Just like who?
How?
What word did you leave last night?
Hello, Peter.
By that time the game will be over.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
No problem.  We're in.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
What scars?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Why did he?
What are you doing up?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
What do you think he did?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
As large as castles.
What time did he get there?
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
About what?
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Feel like practicing?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
They couldn't break the riddle.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
I'm just curious.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
Peter...
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
You're right.  The killer told me.
It's over now.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
I lied.
Lyssa ...
They have Lyssa!
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
There is no other way.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
You have not slept in two days.
I can't reach her.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
<u>Why</u>?
Never.
How did you know?
They can be saddled.
Am I not worth returning to?
Let me comfort you.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
My <u>friend</u>.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
When did you last sleep, boy?
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
What is that awful looking place?
Can't I come, too?
My heart stays here.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
What news from our friends?
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
A fine match.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
Few have survived it.
Look.
She was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
Do not try your trickery on me!
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Who'll I aim at?
Good! First shot!
The yellow and pink.
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Mathilda? May I come in?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
It's too big.
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
...Yes?
...Composer.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
But... He works for your same employer?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Is he still alive?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
I don't accept that.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Are you two planning kids?
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
How long does this... Mania last?
Mine.
Are you a preacher?
So what's the deal Maurice?
I've seen it before.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
The new store?
No.
There's no reason.
I do love you... very, very much.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
That's okay -- really it is.
Why there?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
What did they ask?
To where?
Red flag, man.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
Shit!  He jumped!
Well, hello.
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
I thought you were asleep.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Are you firing me?
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
You're walking to California?
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
I missed you Kris.
You're in pain.
I don't have kids.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
What do you want?
If I was I'm sorry.
Don't run away.
This is the home of an angel.
Yes.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Don't you like me, Ben?
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
How are you doing?
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Where are you staying?
You have been lonely?
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
Why would I kill my husband?
Were you with another man?
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Where you got in the shower.
Huh?
Why the hell not?
What are you talking about?
You're not going up there.
What did you see when you entered the house?
What's going on?
Why didn't you call me?
I'm sorry?
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
Is she?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Picking out my wedding dress!
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
But maybe it's not what you think.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
How can you still believe she's innocent?
So?
The what?
Projecting joy is not my job.
You really think I'm attractive?
Whoa -- Why?
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
Amazing how?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
You go where?
Wow. You're a walking felony.
You look -- nice.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
There he is!
Fool's magic.
You go?  Not watch fun?
Birdies... pretty...
God protect me.
You... you're a beast!
Might we watch, too?
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
You come stealee tleasoo?
No, wait... please... listen...
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
Are we here?
The princess is dead.
By the grace of God.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Fine-looking army.
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Is she... dead?
Wait, Jack.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Why not mine the damned walls?
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
You see!  You see!
Aye... my Lord...
How're these?
Dolt!
Liar!
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Jack!
They tricked you.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
My lady mocks me.
I have no wife.
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Pinching?  Where?
I can't see a thing.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
How do I get the horn back?
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
In every way.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
I'm promised to another!
Praise be to God.
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Hello, Jack.
How came you by this blade?
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
In a dream.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
And video games after!
He's not there.
What's that for?
Mom?
Why?
What's today?
My keys.
I had them in my pocket.
Can you keep Sam straight?
You're a good girl.
Why are you so uptight?
I thought I was helping you.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
I've been here twenty years.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
Sam?
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I did warn you.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
Are you totally insane?!
What are you doing?!
I don't know.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
I'm not even listening.
What would you like to be?
What are you now?
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
I gave up on you.
Are you talking?
Sun glasses?
After everything.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I still don't know what that means.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
What?
Four days.  I left to think.
I was parked in day parking.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
George --
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
I used to live here.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
Finished or unfinished?
Go in there and lick his attitude.
Do you need help?
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
You've never said that before.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
I could die.
Don't move!
I better get the kids home.
Been thinking?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
What the fuck?
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
What are you doing in my room?
You're sure about this?
Adam, that's not true!
No, nigger.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Sharp.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
I got it... boss.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
I've never seen you in here before.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Start your job? What kind of job?
No, tell me what's so funny.
My daddy gave me this watch.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Alright. You want some pie?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
You know what I'm saying.
Come on, Ray, time to go!
It's a pardon from the governor.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
Well, if that's the way it is...
What?!
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Back to New York for starters.
I can't do it.
What'd you say?
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
I can't eat this.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
So it don't exist.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
What do you think about that?
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
They gave me life, mama.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
What's your name?
What are you in for, Willie?
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
Little Nicky.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Try an angel.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
What's Nicky doing down there?
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
You're a good devil, Dad.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Hey...
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
That's a big pass, Elton John.
This don't look good.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Don't do it.
Hey...
You callin' me a thief, my man?
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
Where do you think we came from?
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
That's better.  How do you want us?
How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
What's going on, Logan?!
Why did you do that??!!
What's your name?
Why aren't you in Nursery?
When do you go up?
What's wrong, Available?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
And?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Why tell me?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
Please? What friends?
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
If you did know, you'd tell me.
Uh-uh.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Beloved husband...
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
What belongs to the people?
I'll make the arrangements.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
How did you get here?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
That's better than gold when it's cold.
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
I'm sorry.
Well? How do you like it?
Good... You up for a drive?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
What's happenin'?
You're a musician?
I like to remember things my own way.
Why not?
Why not?
You recognize that guy?
Can I call you?
Sure.
Pete?
I don't know.
Have you partied with him?
What deal?
What's he do?
You liked it.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Set.
Are you my man?
You got him.
You killed him.
Alice...
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Better.
What night is that?
The police called us.
Please tell me.
His condition? What do you mean?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
That's not Fred Madison?
Yeah, Mack?
When he went to work, right.
I want to see him.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
Who is this man?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I won't ever tailgate.
No.
That's it.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
What is it?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
At your house.
Where's Alice?
It must be from a real estate agent.
Same one you were reading the other night?
You're up early.
We will.
Where would you feel safe?
I thought you were getting me a drink?
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Mr. Eddy?
Okay.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
What's goin' on?
What do you want?
Where'd you come from?
I didn't know you cared.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Sorry.
Look here—
He might have lost his way.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
No kidding?
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
Charming chap.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Huh?
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Hey - look!
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Well, it must have taken–
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
He amputated his own leg?
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Charming, isn't she?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Oh, immediately.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
As far away as I ever want to be.
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Are you taking me?
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Oh, stop it!
George, what are you going to do?
What is it?
What's it mean?
I don't know.
Did I say "if"?
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Uh-huh.
Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Maria?
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
You say the porters are waiting for us?
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Where were you hiding?
I guess we're in for it.
A man whose life was empty!
Thank you.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
I'm so glad.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
What do you want him to do?
How about you? Do you want to go?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
No. just peace on Earth.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
what's this?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Jesus Christ...
How does that help me?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
You were saying?
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
So... how'd you hear about this?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
What do we do?
What the hell does that mean?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
What are you doing?
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Nowhere.
Er. well, nowhere special.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Did he say where?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
Kay?  What's your 20?
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
How'd you know?
Please, I want to go back...
She grew up.
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
You don't remember me, do you?
From where?  D.C.?
I put you away --
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Hence the expression...
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Seventeen minutes.
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
You're certain?
If it's a question of authority.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Are you reading my mind right now?
I scored a goal!
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
You're alive?
Oh, Sean --
I forgive you.
Sean, wait...
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
What about the picture --
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
What's so funny?
You don't seem all that proud.
You're talking about the precogs...
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
-- and then walk out.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Lamar, I found something.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
John Anderton was my friend!
He looks familiar.
Howard --
I like it.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
That was our apartment.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
They've never been separated before.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Yes, sir.
I can take you down there.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
Thank you, sir.
Women?
I don't get it. What do you do?
Should I fuck him?
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
No.
Honey?
Oh my god. What happened?
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I feel weird asking him.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
I want you to quit.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
I never promised you anything.
Get your hands off of her.
What's your record at?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
What's his name?
Where is this happening?
He must have that shit troughed.
How so?
You like the ponies?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
I didn't say that.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
You want --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
What's that?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Where is the Soho Grand?
Spa?
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
How am I being shitty?
Ask if he said anything to her.
I think we might.
He implied it.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
We look good this year.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I don't know.
Right here's fine.
I'll get the girl.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
He woulda told us right?
You happy?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
What the hell did you do?
We're not getting whacked.
What are you doing.
Eighty five.
Calm down.
I'm sorry...
So what do we do?
C'mon...
You want to come splash around.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
You strapped?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
Coke?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Nah, man...
Yeah.
So you're our own private guy?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
Yeah.
Don't worry. I get it.
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
No. I'll take a strega.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
Yeah.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Edinburgh.
I'll get it.
Is your papa West Indian?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
It hit?
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
Man live by his rep.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Who the hell are you?
Man, what do you want?
Putting all that poison in your hair.
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
The body is a holy repository.
I can't.
I don't know how.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
Make it plain.
Could we sit down someplace?
Just an idle question.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
Get some sleep.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
What color were the original Hebrews?
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Can I ask you something?
She know?
Is she hooking?
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
Did you hear me?!
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You the man.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
That ain't bad.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
Yes sir.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
[Where are you coming from?]
[Why?]
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
Where do I find you?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Where does he live?
[Reina Rosas.]
[Who pays you?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
What is it?
How does it affect you?
What are you doing here?
You mean a misfire?
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
No.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Hmmm?
You're fast.
What are you doing?
Do you think he'll come back?
So how come you know so much about those countries?
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
What's so important in Los Angeles?
Could I ask you a question?
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
You think too much?
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Creasy... Wait.
Where are you?
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
Good news. You're going back to school.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
Hey, Herbie...
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Waddaya gonna do now?
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
Oh.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Ah?
It pains that they should do this.
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
Yeah.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
Marty...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Sure. This girl said...
It's loaded with what?
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
...and they sit down right next to me...
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Sure.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Okay.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Stop him! Stop that man!
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
Never mind. Forget it.
Never heard of him.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Any time. Whenever we want.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
I was just asking...
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
Black capsule.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
What's the matter?
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
Even if I weren't.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
How much time do I have?
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
Yes, that's what I mean.
Sir?
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
Yeah?
Never mind.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Do you care if I sit down out here?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
Say that again.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Well, maybe you're right.
Okay, fellows.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Baseball?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
How could he be a fake? 
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Sure.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
I want it as soon as possible.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
What do you mean, too bad?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Is there a crowd in the street?
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
Where's the stereo?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
Don't make do it, Mike.
I won't get away with it.
Who's controlling your mind?
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
I hate fucking Springfield.
Hold on a second here.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
That's right.
What do you got on Korda?
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
How do you feel after a shooting.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
What's the point of this?
You'd never been out of New York?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
We see each other every couple of months.
Where did you hear that?
Yes.
How long you been coming here?
Is it always like this?
There's your answer. He's smart.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
McCall, you all right?
Is the hostage injured?
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
I worship you.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
You like this place?
Yeah?
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Scottie, Scottie...
...the hell are you talking about?
You crazy? With all those people around?
Stay up there, Girl...
The car is part of the deal.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
What have you promised them?
It's okay.
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
You were the one who was dying.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
Two maze runners.
You're jumping to conclusions.
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Then you had her killed.
Someone you have to get back to?
I'm sorry.
It was just there.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
I heard that!
... What's happening to him?'
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
I'm in!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
SKULL!!
Hey, boss!
Just shut your gap!
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
That was a CHEAP shot!
How the heck?!...
I am the mighty ape!
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
We're asking you to go to prison.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Boo-Boo.
Are you frightened?
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
Inside, they were talking of you.
You here with Bobby?
Same here.
Have you thought about this?
You could have stopped him.
So you all make the same mistakes?
Charlie?
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
I been thinkin'...
Like Don Maranzano.
How soon can we pull this off?
I like that.
You boys carryin' pieces?
This business is about taking risks.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
What are ya thinkin'?
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
You get fifteen percent.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
Where's the stiff?
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Yes?
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
What?
What's the maximum safe dose?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Holy shit.
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Land of Death. How do I get there?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
What are you watching?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Can't you give it to me later?
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Don't ask where I got it.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
Where'd he go??
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
Dating anyone?
What's wrong?
Mom, I need to talk to you.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Mother!
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Tell me why!
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
What's this, Diz?
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
You play--left field.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Why do I always laugh at that?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
The war's on!
Diz!
Sam Foley--dead!
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Are you ready for him, Bill?
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Jeff for Senator.
A dirty frame!
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
A pet shop?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Mr. President!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Yes, I was--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
For a *question*.
Mr. President--
Mr. President! A point of order!
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
Can't you?
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Good. Where are we?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Have you always had to--work?
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
I know. It's--Violet.
Abigail.
Letitia.
Lena.
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Already? All these letters?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
What are you going to do?
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Order, gentlemen!
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
I know that.
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
Yeah?  And what else?
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Anything *better* to offer?
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Father--oh.
Mr. President...
Will the Senator yield?
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
That's going to be fun.
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
Most every day.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
Have you seen the papers?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
There's Times Square.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
Here's a nice place.
I've often thought about going back.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Yeah, I know.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Well, here we are again.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Uh-huh.
You're acting like a school girl.
Did it?
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
What's bothering you, huh?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Yes, but you said—
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Sit over there, will you?
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Newspaperman?
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Have a drink?
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
That's funny. Why is that?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
We provide opera.
Mrs. Semple?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Brookfield just came in.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
Farmer?
Tails tonight, sir?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
You came home last night - without them.
Please!
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
But she's on the telephone—
Hey, did you hear that?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Me, sir?
Shall I call the police, sir?
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
What are you doing for lunch?
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
What's that?
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
What?
I was... never satisfied.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
You're the doctor, what do you think?
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
You do?
What do you want to know?
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Can you help Mom?
I think you do.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
No.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
I'm not making any promises.
We don't discuss it.
I've offended you!
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
So whose route is this?
And he's where?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Hello?
I guess you saw the show...?
What are you talking about?
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
Would you like another beer?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Hey, Skip.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
Sounds like you have several.
Did you carry a gun?
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
That was a terrible thing.
And how does one do that?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Where's your new friend?
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
Immune from what?
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
The sun turning black.
And what did he say?
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
Two hundred pounds.
You lie.
Fifty percent.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
For what?
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
You two!
No... Why?... Should I?
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
You called me your girl?
Got it!
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
I'm your sister.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Do you really think he'll show up?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Our guests are waiting.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
How about... the Savage Six?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
No one will believe us.
Sounds good to me.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Hey... you okay?
Snap out of it!
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Are you an actress?
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Then why are you here?
What?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
I admire you.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
It's me.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
You're the Sphinx.
Oh don't start that again --
And it would be the right thing to do.
I'm liking this.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
So what else has Superman got?
GET MAD!
So why don't you just tell her!
The who?
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
Agents?
Roy --
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Yes, Obie-wan.
Really?
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
It is?
You did?
She likes you.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Be a Mohican.
Do we have to?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Proceed.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
And who is defending Paris?
General Bonaparte?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
When you eat him, may I have some?
Impossible, I don't believe it.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
And he sent you to me?
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Thank you, Napoleon.
Good evening, sir.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Only Lisette?
No... nothing at all.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
When is she supposed to return?
Will you use the troops?
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Do you expect me to believe that?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
What was there to tell?
You mean you heard them making love?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Is he alone?
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Great moves, Day-Day.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
I ain't trying to rob you...
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
I walked.
You know what this is?
How can they do this?
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
You make it sound so easy.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Huh?
Next time, page me first.
You alright?
Here I come!
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
What it smell like?
Nice neighborhood, huh?
You coming in?
Craig, remember what I told you.
You see that?
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
What is it?
I do.
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Roach...Roach, come on.
He's inside the house?
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Tape his mouth shut.
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
All right, I'll do it.
Where to, sir?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
I need your help.
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
I remember you...in the elevator.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
You're out of your mind.
This says "invitation only".
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
How should I...?
One thirty. California Ballroom.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
But...
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
We have to hurry.
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Lynn!
No. Kisses to you.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
I said I have to do something.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
You're going to go see her.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
Hey!
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
That's pretty good.
It's under control.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
Where's your Mom?
You understand?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
What?
My, that fudge smells yummy!
What could have possessed that girl!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Hing, hang, hung.
Tell me a story, John.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Where are we goin', John?
I'm hungry, John.
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
John, where's your folks?
Did you hear what I said, son?
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
John's bad.
About our secrets.
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
The first night?
What do you figure to do?
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
Get up, Willa.
You were listening outside the parlor window.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Okay, good. She's asleep.
Yeah. So?
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
Rod's not a lunatic.
Dad -- what you doing here?
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
She lived there.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Go even crazier?
What's with the bars?
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
What you dream?
You feel better now, right?
No more fights?
When did you have a nightmare?
Well, here are fifty francs.
Bring me forty-five back.
What is it, Ninotchka?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
An evening gown.
You want this?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
No, that's not him...
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
We don't like Razinin.
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Comrade Buljanoff...
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
The former Duchess!
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
We can wait.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Leon, my little boy.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
Let's do that.
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
Bad news?
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
Yes, monsieur?
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
What's new?
What's that?
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
You want me to go in there?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
What for... why?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
In other words you don't know.
And where are we?
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Then you don't want me to go there.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
What do we do now?
Is that customary?
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
I must go.
As a representative of Moscow...
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Because we are an odd couple.
Probably not.
It's nine o'clock.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Radio! What is radio?
What shall we get? The news!
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
Is this the wish of the masses?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Make it ice cold.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
All right, I'll listen.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Good morning.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Where are they?
Where are they?
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Cigarette?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
He told me to take you to his conference room.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
It's a code or something.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
Sorry ...
I don't have a pistol.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
About a dozen.
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Fucking hell.
Well, why not?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
Who do you think is behind it?
Who we working for?
Where'd you find him?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
No, Henry.  I don't.
... as the old alliances crumble.
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
It was illegal, what he did.
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
You all right?
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
Of them.
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
We lost ...
It makes us human ...
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
Amen to that.
Yeah ... I'm out.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
Hiding what?
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
What?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
Hard to believe.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Carla Jean...
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
...Now that's aggravating.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
...This month's checks.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
It ain't even three years we been married.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Not like that. Not like you say.
Big talk.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Llewelyn.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' where?
You can't afford one?
Promise?
Llewelyn?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I know where the money is.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
Where does he work?
...Where's the transponder?
How'd you find it?
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
...Me?
Will there be anything else?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
Just call it.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Tent poles.
What kind of tent?
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
Okay.
...I'm wondering...
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
You tell me the option.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
So was I.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
Don't jack with me.
Are you in the service?
Nam?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
...I meant your food.
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
Junior year!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Do you know why I'm here?
Did you watch it yet?
The LeSabre!
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
Why do they keep calling you George?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Of course.
I don't think your friend likes me.
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Why are you doing this to me?
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
So, call me when you --
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
Sure you don't want any salad?
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
You don't sound like you're from here.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Guess who I saw today.
Why'd you help me in the first place?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Your husband?!
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
Huh?
Really. And where was that, old man?
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Relax, we brought the cash.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
It's not here. Let's go.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
I'm not telling.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
What doesn't?
You need to remember who you're talking to...
Who's this?
I said 'got it?'
This is Betty at twelve.
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Isn't that the point?
Jesus Christ!
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
Hmm?
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
Because it ain't natural, young man.
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
No... before that.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
Waitaminute -
Hang on there -
...Pete?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Huh?!
What do we do now, Everett?
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Izzat right?
Uh, we uh-
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
What's his name again?
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Yes, but honey -
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
Who was fixing to betray us!
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
An' all my meals for free...
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
It was a moment a weakness!
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Who's the honcho around here?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
It was a powerful air.
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
Daddy!
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Good morning, girls.
Joe!
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I want your D.O.R.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
I want to fly, sir!
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
You're good.
See you in the fleet, sir!
What did you call me?
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Is your brother a flyer?
You're sure it's okay?
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
What other issue is there, Sid?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
You what?
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
That was you guys, huh?
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
How did it go with you guys?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Lynette, where's Sid?
What did you tell him about the baby?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Yeah? Why're you here?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I don't want you to move.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
I'm looking for Sid.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
Hey, you guys still awake?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
He said open it.
Stop it!  Stop it!
Are you okay?
That's your problem.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
The walls are steel, right?
NOT THAT ONE?!
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
I mean it!
Yeah?
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
Suit yourself.
Makes me nervous.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Damn it!
What do we do?
I heard you.
Are you freaking out?
Small space?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Got him!
Do it.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Where is the Glucogen?
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
No...
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
You got to sit on Eldridge...
Get out of the car.
What are you crazy?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
You want me to put a man on it?
Now hold on Rodgers...
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Rodgers... this is no good...
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
We appreciate your help with this.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
What's the pig's name?
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
This cool the heat off you any?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Ain't no one seen him.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You believe that?
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Well?
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
You got salt last week.
You look well, Charlotte.
Shall we proceed?
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Father...
What now, sir?
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
How far away?
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Reverend.
Father... I killed those men...
Honey, Church will be fine.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
I don't get it.
Yeah, sure.
I'm not tired!
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
God, that's fine.
What were you listening to?
What?
I can hardly read these.
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
Going to tell Ellie?
No need to apologize.
I'm not climbing that.
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
It's funny, all right.
Almost there, Louis.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Doesn't look like they last long.
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Let her go. It's cool.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
You stole my boat.
What's in your head, boy?
No!  You gave your word!
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
There's ... another exit?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Do you not know what this is, then?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Man overboard!
Did he speak?
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
I know the code.
It doesn't!
You are despicable.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Why?
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
A fool's errand.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
We had time to get to know each other.
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
You would do that?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
I can get you out of here.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
I swear, you look just like him.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
On what?
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Jack!
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Commodore --
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
What are you going to do to him?
What did you use?
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
Yeah, I do!
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
What are you going to do?
Of course, sir.
I don't believe this is happening...
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Yes?
Daniel...
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Why?
Why do we need it?
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Is something wrong?
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
How far can you stretch?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
No cheese.
That's pretty good.
What's that?
That's going to fit me?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
That's impossible.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Where did you get those letters?
Really?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
—a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
I knew your managing editor very well.
Yale '21, I believe.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
What do you want?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Why not?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
What play?
You're my what?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
That's a canary, sir.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
That's a lovely dress.
The boss is getting hoarse.
My error.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Did who?
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
No.
A statement? Good.
Traps shut!
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
And you struck him right here in our house—?
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
You try it.
Found no skeletons?
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
No. I want to know.
It's okay. It's alright.
Wait.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Bud?
It's alright. Let me see.
You can't go out there.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Sure you are.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
Oh.  I can't.
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
It's not in ME.
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
What color is that hedge of yours?
What are you doing?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Oh my God.
Oh God.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
Jen, listen ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Not directly anyhow ...
You're reading?
How come I'm still in black and white?
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
You got the admissions letter.
Hi.
Mmmmgh.
What's that like?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
... Her father.
McIntire's.
How much does it cost?
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
What?
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
I had nothing to do with that.
Hope you're proud of yourself.
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Bud ...
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Really?
Aren't you a little early?
It's beautiful.
Hey.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
What's the listing?
Yeah, but please don't do that.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
Please don't.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Hello, this is Back.
No.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
....no....
...just talking to you....
No.
Really?
No.
...yeah....well you have me now.
Yes.
I know but I....how much is it?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
So you think you can?
You lied to me?
It was cool last night.
Do you know them.
There's a piano in the street.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Do you want to pick me up?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
You see?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
What happened?
Are you learning how to play it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Hello?
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
For work.....
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
On my knife.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
And your Social Security number.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
No one will know your name.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Sorry about that.
How you doin' Barry?
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
What is this?
No thanks.
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
....now: this pudding?
Where you been?
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
This is Barry.
Nothing.
Hello?
What did you say?
Put him through.
Yeah.
It's not bad, it's ok.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
They can't be serious.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
Don't confuse one organ with another --
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Abbe de Coulmier!
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
It was fiction, of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
Yes?
Here it is; the last chapter.
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
Did I frighten you?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
...yes, I've got that bit...
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
-- words alone are insufficient.
Good God, Marquise --
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
So you ever gonna do a picture?
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
Louis
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
Oh, why is that?
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
There. That's right.
How bad is it?
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
Marion--
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
There's a different between want and
I just want to understand--
He lied to me
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
I wanna see the picture today
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
Not for me.
Sigmund Freud?
Manolete?!
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Let me out.
I don't have it anymore?!
How?
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
Mank!
Shit
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Oh God.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
You're going to destroy it
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
Orson, you wanna take five?
He's Christ?
You want to do the life of Jesus?
We're from...
Believe what you want.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
J.R., glad you could make it.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Yeah --
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
See? That's all there was to it.
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
Can you see it?
Jake...
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
What's the matter with you?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
Why don't you just call him up?
The kids are sleeping.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
It don't look right.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
This is the baby sitter.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
If possible -- both.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
A detective's nightmare.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Hello.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
That's abnormal.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
Her father loading up the shotgun?
You're never going to marry?
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
A Federal offense.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Mrs. Thorwald?
I wonder.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
No.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
Goodnight, you idiot.
How's your leg?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Big enough?
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
So do I.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
What do you think?
What are you getting at?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
I hate funny exit lines.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Meaning me?
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
Any other entrance?
Tell him why we moved here.
You can't protect me.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Yeah!  Shh!
You awake?
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
Will you let him tell it!
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Excuse us a minute?
I was talking to Jim.
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Frank!
John Crawford?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
He has a knife.
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Hey where'd you go?
Come out come out wherever you are!
Here.
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
Plato!
'Bye, Mom.
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Get lost.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
He called me chicken.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
See, I'm new.
Yeah--why--
Goodbye!  See you!
They'll be looking for you.
It doesn't matter to them.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Why did you do that?
Where you going?
Oh, Jim!
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Why?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
What?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Didn't you forget something?
Why?
Must have a way with stationery.
He wants the money.
He wants... your "sister"...
Searching for a money man...
Gabriel!
We sell children's toys --
I don't think it's negative five.
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
NO!
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
Get the hell off of me!
Nick, please, it's me --
No, Nick, no --
Nick died for me....
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
He working for them on this one?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
You... you... YOU --
I saved your life.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
But I never said Rudy.
You... you don't know me --
Who are you now.
What's her greatest fear?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Hell. Ten?
What the fuck are you talking about.
We walked the place for a week.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
They won't recognize me.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
Got something to say to me, Nick?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
No.
No, you're not.
No gun.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Where the HELL did he go?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
How long ago was your makeover?
Monsters in the gelatin...
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
She's using a new perfume.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Jesus, Rudy --
Ash... Ashley...
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
That's what it looks like!
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Me and Mr. White?
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
What's this?
What?
I'm sorry.
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
Follow you where?
For what, the cops?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
Dead.
What's wrong with it?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
I got the diamonds.
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
No shit?
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
Why!
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
Is that supposed to be funny?
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
What's the matter with her?
Our kind of women?
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
There's a nice boy.
We can't stay here!
Coffee?
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Tell me, darling.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
How does she draw?
That's right.
Who's Lednov?
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Is that the only reason you came back?
You'll live.
Yeah, how did you know?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
You're not bein' quite fair.
Don't act so -- crazy.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
You're sure there's more where this came from?
And you're all alone.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
Maybe I better start working on him.
Go on. Have another try at him.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
We got to get movin'.
We got company. Female company.
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Good night, Miss Wells.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Aren't we stayin'?
Then I know my alphabet.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
She was only teasin'.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Are you okay?
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Ouch!!
Help!
It's coming!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Hello Brenda.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
He's right. I should go first.
Hey, you left your book back there.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Listen to me I --
What should we get?
Okay, I get the point.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Oh, right.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Where's Shorty?
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
It was you...
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Are you?
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
I finished all the interviews.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
Professor!
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
I can do it myself.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
Father.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Did you hear?
Bring her home... I guess.
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
CHIP!!
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
He goes to college with me!
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Who is this?
What did you just say?
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
And who may I ask is Carl?
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Man, that one made me puke!
Murder, honey.
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
What is it, Betty?
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
You can't tell.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
How much does she want?
I'll give you a check.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
 What have you done about Irving August?
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Let her know what?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
My window - - through which I see the world.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
And the other was Judd?
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
That makes it all the more difficult ——
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Ann?
No, not really.
You play an instrument?
Oh, uh-huh.
Mother, father, sister.
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
So what about kids?
Does it bother you?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
My therapist said that --
Are you in the middle of something?
What are these?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
This is just... so...
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Tell me your name.
Yes.
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Yes, I have. I will.
No.
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
Can't.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
I can't.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
I can't tell you like this.
Come on!!
I want to know why you are the way you are!
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
John?
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Where did you go when you left here?
You son of a bitch!!
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
What do you mean?
God, no.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
What do you mean, like physically?
What brought this on?
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Lose something?
Questions about sex.
What!?
I wanted him to see me.
He wouldn't do that.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Here it is.
Do you have my work number?
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Were you disappointed?
Then what happened?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
No.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
No.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I've got to get back to the office.
Hello.
Not today. I've got other plans.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Why not?
Hung up.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Plenty of room for two people.
Answer him, goddammit!!
Mr. Millaney?
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Jesus!
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Where is he now? Do you know?
You say something?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Good shape for an old man, eh?
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
So who changes?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
Yeah? What do I do then?
BREAKING OUT
How's Brad?
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
When do I get to see Brad?
SIN-I-FUL
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Could I do that later?
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
F for...
F for...
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
CRIMINAL
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The fuck was that?
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Bye.
Are you there? Miles?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Two years ago, buddy.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
What happened to you guys?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
What do you smell?
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
So what should I wear?
Does she know about Saturday?
What?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Call me on my cell if you go out.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Been checking your messages?
What is it?
Is it the money thing?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
I said okay?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Do you like them?
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
That's thoughtful.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Come on, let me drive.
What the fuck!
Well. That about does it.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Hi.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Hello?
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
You quit drinking?
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
Should we get dessert?
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Stephanie! Stop!
You talked to Wendy?
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
I don't want you to die.
Hi sweetie.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
...Tell Graham --
I'm not going to curse.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Explain noises.
No I'm not.
Do you think it's a possibility?
They're distracting us?
How many died?
It needs batteries.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Stop crying!
Second thing this week I can't explain.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
I didn't know you were out.
Forget it.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
Where are we?
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
You might make a farmer yet.
Where is Rae?
Who?
Never will again.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
Where's your brother?
Who is he?
What are you talking about?
What's all this then?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
What brings you into my saloon?
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
You work here?
Nifty.
And I know what I'm talking about.
It's the only place I'm happy.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
The picture's dead.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Even the fall from the plane?
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
She doesn't want pity.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
Hello?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
You're with me to be close to her?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
How will you do our love scenes?
For her?
You have to see her.
-- We call them "vactors".
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
You know me -- married to my work.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
Why didn't she thank you?
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
Do I know you?
I know what you're up to.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
What if it catches on fire?
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Wow. They called you their son.
Why did you leave me?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
You want to ask me a question?
You said the "s" word.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
That isn't magic.
How often do you see them?
Are you wigging out?
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I wish I were somewhere else.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
I'd give anything to have been there.
You can see her?
Cole, you're scaring me.
Dead people?
Stuttering--
'Course, it's none of my business.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Bitch.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
Come on --
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
"Peggy-Sue" --
Well, there goes our record deal.
So... what does it do?
Should we be doing this, dude?
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
How... was she "called?"
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
You'll be back.
Throw me one.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Chicken sandwich?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Shit!
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
So?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
No --
Mac... let's get out of here.
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
What?
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
It's my nature.
Where are you?!
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
What the hell are we going to do?!
What?
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Are you nodding?
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Flip.
I loved you. I loved --
When one sees you they all see you.
You.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
You got my barley pop?
Why? You have a bowling date?
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Driving, talking to me...
What the hell's going on?
Can I ask you something?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
Hey...
Jesus!!!
What the hell are you doing?!?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
An unmarked police car.
Kate...
What kind of a guy is he?
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
But you'll do it?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
No what?
Order up!
Cledus.
Or in the slammer.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
No.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
He's history.
Shit! No one's here.
Let's get the hell outta here.
We still on schedule?
Bandit I, do you copy?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Never mind. It's nothing.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
Bandit II?
Breaker. Breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Oh.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Is your security team armed?
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
How bad?
No.
Two of 'em?
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
What happened?
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
What'd you say?
About what?
...I'm sorry...
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
You got clicks, anything?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Wow.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
What'd you say?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
Bulllllshit...
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
You murdered her!
Why would you let her to do that?
You fucking bastard...
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
Probably.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
I need to see Snow.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
Why did you say those things?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
But we fought.
You don't want me.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
Do you want to stay here?
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Is that really what you want?
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Gibarian was under enormous --
Are you nervous?
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
You all right?
Didn't do very well, did you?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
Yeah.
You asked.
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop, will you?!
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
You don't want to know.
Where?
They guys treatin' you all right?
I'd miss my life...
Say goodbye, Mike.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
... just saying you should think twice about it...
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
So how'd it go?
Okay?
Honey.  You got him.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
Mike, take it easy...
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
What about when she identifies him?!
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
No, I will not step outside.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Nice threads Dad.
How are things going, pal?
Shooting.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Sexual tension...
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
Here you go, Pete.
What, want a glass?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Flash, drop it--
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Jesus Christ.
Are you okay?
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
What's this? A cockaroach?
You're making my life difficult.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Uh is a good start.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
Peter?
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Absolutely no class.
Poison emergency.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
A bit melodramatic… but if you could prove it… that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
Creation? Or its opposite?
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Jawohl.
Jawohl!
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
You make my mouth water.
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Jawohl.
Jawohl!
Shut up, Animal!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Let me go! Let me go!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Harry -- I'm blind!
What do those broads say?
That's what I wanna hear.
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Grable, not Gable!
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
What about Schulz?
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Anybody call?
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
You off your rocker?
What are we going to do with him?
You could use a new one yourself.
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Ach so!
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
I'll kill you for that!
Good morning, Sefton.
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Is it all right if we smell it?
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
It's working.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Data, are you all right?
What do you mean?
That's where he's going.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
These are my children...my children.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
I don't understand.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
We don't have a tractor beam.
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
The Nexus.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Mr. Chekov -- ?
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
What is it?
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
What's wrong?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
The Genesis planet is gone.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
Count on our help, sir.
See! That shimmering area.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
Close... There --
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Will you be able to handle that...?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Yours...?!
Wait! Give me a chance --
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
... He spoke of your friendship.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Sir, may I suggest --
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
500 Kellicams!
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
Wait --
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
He's on a build up to detonation!
It was just words.
Thirty seconds...
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Scotty -- what's left?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
And who is this?
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
I know of your fondness for antiques.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
It literally is Genesis...
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
They knew just where to hit us.
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Spock!
... the good of the few...
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Very well.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
May I speak, sir?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
I did not think so.
Khan!
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
That was close --
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Time!
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
You lied.
Humans make illogical decisions...
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
Bones --
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
That's crazy!
What did you say she was getting?
An experimental device, doctor.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
... I don't think he understands...
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
No choice now, Scotty!
Yes, sir.
"Neutralized?" How?
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
So you were at Berkeley.
You sure you won't change your mind?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
Iowa.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
You're upset about losing the whales.
How will that be done, exactly?
Where could you take them?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
I'm all ears.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
So. There we are.
Here... In the park?
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
You tricked me.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
Where are you going?!
Spock...?
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Spock: Condition report!
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Any luck...?
Estimate range, ship to whales!
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Scotty, how long is this bay?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Full power, sir.
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Right on. You fly?
Father...?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
There are days.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
Really.
No... I want to stay with you...
I have to go home now.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Will he live?
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Implants bothering you?
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
What's inside that nebula cluster?
They're powering their forward weapons array.
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
You haven't done that in a long time...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Why don't you try sitting up?
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
It's Cochrane.
Are you saying they won't help us?
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
Do you know what this is, Data?
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Yes...
Isn't it better like this...?
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
I have helm control.
What year is it?
Who are you?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
What did you do to the batteries?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
Captain, the Enterprise!
Their com system must still be down.
ATR setting...
Yes.
Where in the States?
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Cochrane?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
What?
We?
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Captain...?
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
What are they doing?
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Report.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Even Data?
I believe the operation is over.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
Figures.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Specifically of...?
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
WHAT HAPPENED?
He's a DOCTOR!
Are those your words?
For insubordination.
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Just the size of my head -
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Where IS the conference?
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
An INCIDENT?
Isn't it about time you became something else?
How much time's left of your sentence?
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Aye, sir.
Captain, our shields -- !
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
Where?
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Captain --
Uhura?
How did you - ?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
NO WAY!
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
I do not understand.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Indefinitely.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
Beverly, come in.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
What is our approximate distance?
It's you.
May I have this dance?
Counselor.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
Imzadi. This is so good.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.

I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
With or without the rest of the fleet?


I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
To find the head, sir?
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Report.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Praetor?
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
It's not quite the face you remember.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Hello, Jean Luc.
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I’ll snap its ugly head off.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
So they’ve got him up and running.
My God...
Intruder alert!
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
How long until we reach the Rift?
How many Warbirds will you need?
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Gate three. It's boarding now.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Where's that?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
Hello George.
What's all this for?
No deal.
George... Do you hear me, George?
Mrs. Haydn...
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Steering wheel...
What?
Money.
Shit.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
What is...  ...Coke?
I...
What?
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
Sun...
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Jennyhaydn.
You thought we were a different planet?!
You did? That's funny. So did we.
The captain...
What are you doing?
I like this music.
You liked my singing?
You can have one.
I will go. But not you.
What are you saying?
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
What?
You don't forget anything, do you?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
Oh, you're pretty...
They are beautiful.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Where do you think you're going?
I told you I'm looking for someone.
Is it for real?
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Can you see under the faceplate?
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
We can't let you do that.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
You have to go.  I mean it.
You talked to Iris?  When?
That's a good one, coming from you.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
Clips.
Talk to me about costs, here.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
You were lucky, Max.
Let's work it.
Whattya mean?
What stuff?
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
About what?
It's alright.  He means it.
Nero.
Commissioner Strickland.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
That would be no.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
Forget her.
What is it?
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
No more, Lenny.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Those two guys were cops.
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
I guess.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Agent Mackelway.
What does the Manager say?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
I've been looking for you.
He was sitting here?
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
Do you think he singled you out?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
None taken.
Doesn't fit.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
What's that?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
I've been thinking about this.
Just routine stuff.
You mean --
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
Jaime --
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
What happened?
Agent...
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
[Lionheart, what happened?]
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
I want to go live with you.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Thomas Mackelway.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
Koessler?
No.
"MyDick?"
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
Ever since I've known you.
Are you calling Her?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
I like quiche.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
I thought I was going to die.
To do what?
Anything?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
...not until you book it...
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Huh?
Well, who represents you back east?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...Which one...?
...well, it suits you...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
So I don't call either way.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
I mean, I need the money.
It's definitely a step back for me.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
I'll give you an eight. 
An eight.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
Kinda money, huh?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Him?
There are so many beautiful women here.
I got to at least try once.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
I'm such an asshole.
They turned you down?
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
Pause it. 
What's he do?
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Don't call me ever again.
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
That's right.
Hello?
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Wait.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Vegas, baby!
Wake up, baby.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
That's not cool.
It doesn't matter...
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
What an asshole.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
I know. I know.
...Baby...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
I gotta use the phone.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Christy was nice...
She didn't like me, anyway.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
What time's this party tonight?
...the Copa, in New York...
You looked right at her, baby.
She didn't see.
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
Because he's a bitch.
...against the computer.
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Oh, it's on, baby...
Now?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
...Shut up, Sue...
It is on.
Sorry man.
The bear's got his claws back.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
And you?
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
The Court gave you justice.
Be my friend.
What do you wish me to do?
What's the matter, Carlo?
The food is on the table.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
You take care of Paulie?
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
You look terrif on the floor!
No.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
You take care of your family?
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
You tell us about America.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Hey, beautiful girls!
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
I know about what you mean!
Ever seen anything like that before?
Who are those girls?
Give them some money and send them home.
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
One of Tattaglia's people?
Jesus, I don't know...
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
What about McCluskey?
They're talking to themselves.
What time do they expect us?
Michael, what are you doing?
Hello.  Kay?
I can't...
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
You think I scam?
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Yeah.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Hi Tom.
I'll come down.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
You'd say if you mind?
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Who's this?
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
Could we sail to Venice?
You're breaking my ribs!
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
I've got plans!
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
Marge-maintenance.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Hardly.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
He hates being confronted.
Oh my God. Tom.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Dickie?
What?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
That's a terrific idea.
I found Dickie's rings.
Marge? Where are you going?
It's all true.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Where's Dickie's father?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Which is?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
And tomorrow?
My God.
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
That's good, isn't it?
I've been backpacking.
What did he say?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was that Meredith?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
It is a little coarse, yes.
I have!
How much to get a permit to carry?
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Yes?
Where do you live?
Really?
Huh?
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
What are you doing?
But this is a porno movie.
This is sort of high class...
Well... mostly...
Hello, Travis.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Oh, Tom, please.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Just what?
No, why?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Why you hang around with them greasers?
What's your real name?
That's a nice name.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
But that one night?
Well, you want to or not?
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
God, you are square.
What's so important?
How?
Got your license?
So whatja do now?
Also clean.
Twenty-six.
No, I want long shifts.
So I hear.
Is that so?
Sure.
I'm no cop.
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Yeah.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Not really.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
Spit it out.
It's me sir.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
Well yes I suppose ...
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Surprise, surprise.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
You've got everything?
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
You first.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Well, there's got to be a way...
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Here we are.
Are you saying that he's...
Mother o'god...
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Wait'll you see the inside!
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Well...
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Zackly.
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
Any idea how you got here, son?
Here, one of mine.
What is it?
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
That's where you live.
You kids off to the dance?
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
When'd you quit smoking?
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
That was beautiful.
Found me.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
What happened?
Ancestors?
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
You hungry, son?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Thank you.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
And what had you done?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Is anyone there?
Are you coming to my party?
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
What?
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Do you know him?
See them two big trees across there?
Of course.
I wonder if you could tell me...
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
When do you think they'll come?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mother, get a rope!
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
No.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
He was killed last night. By birds.
Well, where did he go?
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
I wonder if you could help me.
I understand completely, sir.
But how... how do you know my name?
How?
I didn't break that window!
I think you're a louse.
So you're a lawyer.
What kind of law?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Yes, but...
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Why did he shoot her?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
Without any clothes on?
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Do you expect me to believe...?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Do you want some mustard with this?
Really? Tell me about it.
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
I think it's safe to get out now.
Do you want to try your father again? 
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
We'd better light some of those lamps.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
I don't know why.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
Help how? What do you want to do?
How do you plan to do that?
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
I fear he may have to.
I'm only a student.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
I'm cold as ice.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Dr. MacFarlane --
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
I thought this was a school day.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
No.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
But what makes a thought start?
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
This is a gift you'll not return.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
A pleasure to torment me?
What did you hear?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
How long ago?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
Crony indeed!
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
Check and mate.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
Where is it? This place?
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
Wrong. Answer.
Fuck. Me.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
You're him. Corvis.
I was a friend of your sister's.
Yeah, no kidding.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Are you ok?
Erin. It's not your fault.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
Erin. Who?
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
An accident, Nathan.
Anything wrong?
You want me to walk a straight line?
What? What is it?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
You're in with them.
Sweetheart...
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Such power exists?
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
Just twelve.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
Hello.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
But I suppose you know the answer.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
I don't like horror comics.
All day.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Why not?
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
They're looking at us.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
We are awesome monster-bashers!
That's right.
I'm my own man.
Where you going?
Look.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
Of course not!
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
You like Michael.
I'll hitch.
See you later.
Sure.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Lights out, Sam.
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
Something the matter?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Are you following me?
Let's go see them.
When?
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
This is kind of a cool place.
This room is mine.
You're beautiful.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Do I have to do this?
Did you spill something?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
What do you want from us?
Where these tracks headed?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
How you doin', old boy?
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
We got to burn 'em.
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
What's happening?
Torch it over there!
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
What do we do about those three?
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
Not the only one.
Hey, Sweden!!!
I guess you're okay.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Somebody definitely messed with it.
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
He might just wait us out.
This storm do that?
What is it?
Where was he trying to go?
What about Childs?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
We should sleep in shifts.
You hear that?
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
Yes.  Just about here.
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
Because you'll never die.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
My God... I saw this.
It's what they want you to see.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
What's your name?
What?
Why?
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
That was a foolish thing to do.
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
You're late.
My God...
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
I was not.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
I'm sorry, David.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
You wouldn't believe me.
I can't do that --
I can't leave when I'm so close.
Good night, David.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
Is there a lot of illness?
Oh, that explains everything.
How long ago?
The mud carriers.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Alexander...?
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
It was different then.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
And roosters.
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
He said he traveled for two months.
You won't even try?
If I might explain, sir --
Yes, sir.
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Relax.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
And what's that?
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Who are you?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
Did you know my father?
What should they be looking for?
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
You're just gonna walk?
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I gave you my dog tags.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
How long do we have?
Me, too.
What? What are you thinking?
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
Where are we going?
I've been ok.
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
You were convicted of the crime.
My God you look exactly like him.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
What about the world?
How do you know about Eugene?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
No.
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
I'm sorry.
Hon?
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Honey?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
Good God.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
Did you get married real young?
You're a bank robber?
What?
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Do you love me?
Who did it?
What?
Hey, peaches.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Will you at least see how it fits?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Front.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
I'm cash poor.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
How do I look?
Drive!  Drive away!
You think you've found your calling?
You're disturbed.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Idaho?
Like a Chihuahua?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
I am really sorry about this.
What?
Ready?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
I said all that?
You awake?
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
What?!  What d'you think?!
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
What in the hell is it?!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Are you going to apologize or not?
Where you goin'?
Oh, Jesus!
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
I'm asking you to leave.
Gay? He said you were gay?
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Mary again.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
You're kidding? What did they say?
Well? What are you waiting for?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
Mary.
Who?
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Stalker, huh?
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Oh yeah.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
How about -- ?
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Are you okay?
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
I don't buy it.
She's blackmailing you, right?
You want her dead, don't you?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
Four kids, three different guys.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
Hey, hey, hey!
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Among others.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Oh... Sully.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
I see where you're going.
How do you guarantee that?
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
I can live with those reflections.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
So who's the lucky guy?
What's he like?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
An old flame?
Magda!
Pat does projects all over the world.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
What's up?
What...?
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Hi, Ted.
Are you all right?
Ted, are you okay?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Now by killer, you mean...?
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
Twenty-two.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Get out.
Please leave.
What what are you doing here?
Ted...?
But but what about Steve?
Yeah? What do you want?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
Hey.
Eh.
See you, Warren.
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
Good.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
I'll do it.
Jesus...
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
That is correct.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Max.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
When are you going to be home?
What's happened?
I want an hour with him.
So what've we got today?
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
I see.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
A murder. On the reservation.
What are you doing?
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
What the hell you doing?!
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
Couldn't sleep.
Meet me at base. Over.
Who is he?
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
What'd she say?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
What?!
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
What's he smoke in that?
What was he saying?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
It's not real.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
He's gone.
You take care.
You're the Indian FBI.
This Jimmy's?
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
Thank you.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
X21. Come back.
What ya want?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
No way. No fuckin' way.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
It isn't?
How so?
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
The what?
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
There you go with those moves again.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
I'm different.
Let's make it at eight.
It dies. We live.
No!
You ever think about killing another human being?
Does it bother you?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
You don't believe that.
What do you do when you come here?
Goose is dead.
What does it mean?
Looks like a tie.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
Well?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Let's hope you're right!
That's missile lock!
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
You're not supposed to...
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
What do you want?
Why do you all have such funny names?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
What are you doing?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
I'm pinned to the panel.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
1000.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
GET LOST!
You saved our lives. You did it!
Who is the best.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
Helping him in.
It was bad.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
How do you feel?
Goose is dead.
I called your house.
Not something they tell dependents.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
What's wrong with this one?
Where's yours?
What to the rebels want?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Need a ride?
Shut up and drive!
What do you want?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
But I thought...
Kill him.
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
What do you want?
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
You open it.
Suppose I do...then what?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Pull them out.
Yeah.
They found us!  Everybody out!
I did?
Where?
I want that fucker dead.
Where is he?
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Is that better?
Nobody?!  What's her name?
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Let's do it.
And you believe him?
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
What are you doing?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
And falling in love?
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
All right.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
Don't be ridiculous.
Now what?
What can I do?
Like what?
I don't need Kuato for that.
Where are you going?!
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
What's wrong?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Yeah, still got one poking around.
How much you think?
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Oh my God.
We're not going over there, right?
So...now what?
You didn't cook breakfast?
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
What the hell are they?
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Its tires are flat...
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Yeah...but no ties.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Burt!  Heather!
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
You sure this is where it was?
Come on.  Get away from it!
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
What's it doing?
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
...we had to lick his boots clean.
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
You're implying that I planted a gun?
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
Eddie Dowd.
So what're we gonna do?
-- Eddie...
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
I embellished.
I embroidered.
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
I killed the motherfucker.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
Afraid of what?
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
Edward T. Dowd.
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
In those days, they often worked as a team.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
No.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
CIA?
Tell me some other things about her.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Here he comes.
Don't get funny with me again.
Let's ditch this place and party.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
You try that you little monkey.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
He's dead -- good and dead.
He didn't suffer.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
You better dust this place, Sam.
The usual, 9:15.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Laura?
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Where are the Cookies?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
But I love you, Laura.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
Right on time, baby.
James...
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
I've got to see you.
What do you mean?
You always hurt the ones you love.
You want to see...
You're getting warmer.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
Can I take the car?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
School?
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Leland, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
I don't know.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Neurology?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
How is that?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
I did.
Ed Concannon.
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
Anything special about the case?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Dr. Thompson...?
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
I am seventy-four years old.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
Do you know who her doctors were?
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Mrs. Simmonds.
One hour.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I need an extension for my case.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
Really. How wonderful for you.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
I've got to work...
Do you think it's my fault?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
Not if you don't grow up...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Joe...  Joe...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...You saw her?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
Dr. Gruber.
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
Hi, Mickey...
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Mick. Mick. Mick...
...he's a good man...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
No.
Right.
So what?
Today is Tuesday. What?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
What are you doing in New York...?
I just saw her.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Yes.
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Hey, there - open up!
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
You look kinda lost yourself.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
I do know him...slightly.
They've all stopped at the same time.
The troops are certainly moving in here!
Where are we?
What was it like?
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
They've blocked it!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
Doctor...
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
no.
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
Rex saved me.
Time for sleep.
Who?
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Dylan, where's the man?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
What...happened?
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Captured?  How?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Looks like weather.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
You may not like what you hear.
What are they doing?
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Where's Mom?
Fine.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
I couldn't have done it without you.
You know, I never had friends like this.
He does.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Passport?
Good.
I feel like I got you into this.
So... What happened?
What'd you do?
It works?
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Northeast sir!
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
But you invited is aboard.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
What is it we can do for you today?
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
How would you know?
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Well, that was neighborly.
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
How long you been standing there?
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
Suicidal...
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
They are much more than that, sir.
Yes.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
What's Cao Ben?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
I'm from all over.
How 'bout a beer?
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
Club Zanzibar.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
The Good Witch...
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
I'm scared, mama.
Hey baby...
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
You're perfect for me, too.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Sailor?
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
What's that, honey?
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
Huh?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
How'd you know my daddy?
They have, sugar.
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
Now what?
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
That you, Sail, honey?
You find any work?
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
I mean tomorrow.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
I knew you'd want it again...
You need to explain it.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Through the forehead?
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Put your shoulders back.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Where we goin'?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
You snore.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Tripp!
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
He has a book.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He lives with his mother.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Crabtree.
Shut up, James.
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
So whose car is it?
The hood jumper?
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Me? What can I do?
You peeked, didn't you?
No...
I'll be... somewhere else.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
No. There's no one here.
Yes. But that's not why I called...
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
...reconcile with Emily.
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
You cold, James?
So what are you doing out here?
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
Maybe she didn't come here.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
When?
Near Carvel?
Get out of here.
Me? Sure. Why?
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Who's gun is that?
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Pow.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
Sara.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
Ouch. How many?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Did you tell Walter?
Does he still love you?
Did you just make that up?
You don't deserve me, you know.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Grady?
What is it, Grady?
Is it good?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
Annette? She's good... tense.
I'm working on it.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Aren't you glad?
I'm just talking, man.
What do you mean?
They're starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
It's just a city park.
How does it sound?
I'd love to hear it.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
You don't know?
I think you do.
Doesn't everybody?
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Too much sun.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
The passionate one?
But you are taking it?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Yeah, like the bird.
No.
What?
No thank you.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
What's her name?
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
How do you know?
And how's your job?
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
How's the journal?
You don't like coming here, do you?
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
You have no feelings for your niece?
Then why are you talking about this?
How long is this going to take?
Will I ever be normal?
You couldn't say.
I want to be normal!
You don't know!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
That's not a helpful answer.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Sorry.  Where is she?
How old are you and your sister?
What the hell are you doing there?
I'm only asking questions.
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
What's weird about that?
You never spoke to me before.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
You plan to drink both those beers?
They could eat you.
So... what's your dark secret?
How about in the morning.
It's not what you think.
I got poked around... here and there.
I've got problems.
Thank you.
Don't be scared, Walter.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
You got it?!  You got it?
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Where are we?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
What's the scoop, ace?
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
No.
He's got the shakes?
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
No, Bud, no... not you.
Did you find Wilhite?
Virgil?
Do we just leave him there?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Cab One, radiation readings?
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
Getting a reading?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
A little more so this time.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
But where are you going?
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Somebody must live here!
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
Claudia, listen to me...
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
What is it, Claudia?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
No, Sandro... Please...
What are you saying?
I'm too sleepy.
Good night, my love.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Do you consider that a compliment?
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
Who are you talking to?
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
What happened?
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
And what are we going to do now?
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Giulia...
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
We have a radio like this, too.
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
But where did you come from?
Whose boat is that?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Zuria?
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
She'd punish me.
No.
Because I'm getting fat.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
It's a sin to be fat.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
No I don't... the host is enough.
You've been alone together?
And you like that?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
I don't know.
What baby?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
I... I don't understand.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
No questions.
Do you know a Marie?
Like what?
You have trouble sleeping?
What things?
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Did your mother see angels often?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
Agnes...
What did you do?
And that you're stupid?
That you're a mistake?
You're a mistake.
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
I really love you.
Who am I?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Of telling you.
Why were you afraid?
Would you like to tell me?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
What is it?
A wastepaper basket.
No.
Of what?
Him.
She'd seen him too.
Stay away from me...
No...
I hate him for what he did to me.
For what he made me go through.
I hate him.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
She took the baby in her arms?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
???
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
No.
Do you still go to church?
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
Is that normal?
Was there a priest?
Who?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
The Catholic Church...
She is not a child.
???  
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
I am...
All right, what do you need.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Oh, Dear God...
When was that?
Your niece!
Do you know what she did to her?
And my permission?
Would you like one?  Huh?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Even Christ would partake socially.
Mary Magdelen?
I'd like to begin.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
That's what I have to believe...
This is permission to take her apart.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
Too late for what?
You wanted that child out of the way.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
Nine.
Eight and two thirds.
Well --
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
You don't think...
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
We're nearly there, sir.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Are you going in?
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Oh, there you are!
Well ... come on.
I don't think that bit's right.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Gear?
Aye, I knew you were.
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Parading's better!
A book!
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Gie's a kiss!
Give 'em a pull.
Behave...
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
What's old got to do with it?
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Hi Norm!
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
And my nose...
Is it?
Aye, but you know him well.
It'll only get you into trouble.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Where's my grandfather?
That's mine.
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Stop picking on him.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
How's that?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
I got it.  Oh boy.
Activate lifter quads.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
Breathe deeply.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
How long to fix?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
What the hell's going on?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
Hey now, what is this?
There.  Should be coming through about there.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
He's running a fever.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
Now what's wrong?
Can you get them back?
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
This should do it.
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
First contact...
What's the frequency?
It's stopped?
They're on the next level up.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
We do know that.
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
It's out of focus.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
I understand why you did that.
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
We won't need it then.
Yes!
Where are you?
Now what?
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
What is it?
It's a rhino.
Where're they headed?
It's too late!
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
One of 'em must have escaped.
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Alright, okay.  Look...
Careful of that edging there...
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
What happened?
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
There's still time to back-out.
Thanks.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Six month stint on Datus.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
I've found Ackland!
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
Do you believe him?
What?
That's the wrong way!
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Where'd you leave them?
How's it going?
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
How do you know my name?
And what is your name?
Phoebe?
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
I don't think that's funny.
Just like it.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
What time?
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
You sat and talked until it was light...
What do you take me for?
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
What do you mean by that?
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I'm tired. I want to go home.
We never met. That's why.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
You've already met.
Good luck, genius...
When? When are you going to do it?
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Then you're crazy.
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Need any help?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
For instance what?
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
The audition.
The kid. Junior.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Hello, what's your name?
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Why?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
So few come back...
Yes. Yes, it does.
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
You hear all kinds of things.
Find out.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
You need new girdles.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
Birdie-
You don't like Eve, do you?
An answer.
What are you doing here?
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
Not at all.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
May I have your coat?
Oh, but there is-
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
But the raves about your performance-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
I think I know...
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Lloyd, what happened...?
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
I'm glad Bill's back.
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
Would you, really? How sweet-
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
"Liebestraum."
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Promise.
Are you breaking the contract?
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
Carl?
All right, what do we know?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
--I'm trying--
Were you eyebrow reading?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
'68.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
I think that's him.
--jeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
--what time is it?
I'll never get out of here in time.
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Can't help you.
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
What's a real denial?
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
Hey, easy...
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
One minute but then--
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
The ones who could disburse the money.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
No games, Irwin; give.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
What happens when the baby comes?
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
Just tell me his title.
--what do you think?--
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Go on.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Talk about Segretti--
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
Who's Charles Colson?
--who you got?--
--has any of them got an ax?--
What else have you got?
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
Good morning gentleman.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
Of course, Finch.  What?
What are we gonna hear?
You don't like it?
Why are you doing this?
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
So you're going to Michigan?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
What about the game?!
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
There's our man.
Gotta go.
Like a bet?
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Did I miss anything?!
That's stupid.
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Okay.
Dad!  I know!
Dad.
What was your name again?
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
...excuse me?!
This'll do.
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
What's up, fellas?
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Uh...
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Let me know.
Vicky, wait.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Now?!
You comfortable?
Yeah Vick?
That was a great night.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Feeling better, Oz?
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
So does your tongue cramp up?
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Kevin, it was just a --
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
NOVA!!
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Really?
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
Merde! Just missed!
Merde! I can't believe this!
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Sure. I can follow that.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
What makes you so sure this will work?
I don't know...
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Holy mother of God...
Didn't even have to ask.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
Claude...?
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Another step and he's dead!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
We know you were with her.
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Uncle Terrence.
Because Gaston was after it.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Uncle Terrence?
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Where is it! Please!
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
What've you got?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Who did you hear it from?
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Noooo....
No! I look ridiculous!
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
Why do you want to go to Paris?
Every Russian family has one..
What a beautiful ship!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Oh! I'm sorry...
No! Well, yes, but
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
I'm getting a chest cold..
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
What do you want?!
I'll show you!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
It's an important issue.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Stop it, Alvy!
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Hi. Hi, hi.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Uh, you're driving a-
Oh, you do?
Oh, right.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
No, I got time.
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
what I mean?
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay?
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
Yeah?
No.  You're a wreck.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
Those are the two categories...
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
And blind people, crippled...
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
That's the key question.
I know you've only known me a short while.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
How is it any different?
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
Really?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Well, what is your definition of following?
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
M'hm.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
What's- It's me, open up.
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Remember, we had that thing.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
God.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Oh, good. Okay.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Bad?
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
Sixteen years ago.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Ah.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
M'mmm.
Well, hi!
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
No, no, no, not at all.
Yeah.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Did you know the contractor?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Isn't Skye amazing?
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
I have a small window of time.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
What what's about?
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
So?
The suspense is killing me.
But she's alright.
Stupid tart.
And you know our friends, how?
Oh.  You're them.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Are you my big hard hero?
Oh yeah?
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Go.
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
Scout's honor.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
Kiss the back of my knees.
No.  Did you?
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Fuck you.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
About me!
It's a shit novel anyway.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Cal, too?
Yes.
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
It's a novel.
Yes I did.
I meant Sally.
Please, Ryan.
Something soft.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
Ryan's really angry with me.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
That's very nice.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
I think there are sixteen there.
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
Ryan.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
That was my clue.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Like the last time.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
What did I do?
You're keeping a record, are you?
I didn't know you had this.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
You don't need to do that.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
He's a novelist.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Break's over.
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
Someone who follows his heart!
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Really?
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Worker!  Come back here now!
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Z!  what are you doing?
Bala!
Z!  Over here!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
ARREST HIM!
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
What do you see out there?
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
That makes me feel just terrible.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
You mean tonight?
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
I forgive you.
One more?
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
What is it?
Your phone.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
What's your friend's name?
What's her first name?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I don't want it.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
Too slow?
Do I have to?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
What are you doing with that?
Thank you.
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
We're going to finish that gin game.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
Where are you going, Baxter?
How would you like to go tonight?
This?
I am?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Well -- I guess so.
Oh, yes. Thanks.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
You're going to take her off my hands?
You left your wife?
I see.
No key!
Now hold on, Baxter --
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
On account of me.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
How do you spell her last name?
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Yeah, wasn't I?
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Still stuck on her, huh.
Say, this is Snugsville.
No kidding.
Not so rough, honey.
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
That guy really must've belted him.
And what happened to you?
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
I don't believe you.
That's enough, Fran.
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
What !
Who the hell are you?
What unit were you with ?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
And the grass?
That's a light down there --
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
Can I go get those mangos now?
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
They nail him for it bad ?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
I only met Kurtz once.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Spooky.
No, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
I thought he was a lame.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
What's your name, sailor ?
Good swell.
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Gimme water.
Yes...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
Are you finished surfing?
No -- no, Captain.
You hear it again?
You think he'd of shot us?
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
What's this tiger shit?
The other one --
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
This boat's a mess.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Who are you?
Cognac?
What will you do after the war?
Yes.
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
What if I say no.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
34   CONTINUED:
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Stay here.
I'll go into town with you.
Was there any trouble?
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
What's going on?
Desmond.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Surviving is what I know --
Been driving long?
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
Have to get these wet things off.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Can you walk?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
All this for laying traps on private land?
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
What's wrong?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Thought that door was open last night...
You hear me?  Ben?
Meaning he'll need a plane.
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
I know. He's just the best.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
Oh, please...
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
Getting loud, getting loud.
Lovely.
My son.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Hey -- you let him...
Stop asking everyone.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Sex with Simon?
I'll take you... why not?
Hello.
That seems like a good choice.
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Well...
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Uh-huh...
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
But what about...
One night with me!
What the heck do you mean?
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
You changed the room around...
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Oh, is he dead?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Which color was that?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
Not it at all, really.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
Did you like it that much?
What's wrong?
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Why are you doing this?
What?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You can't --
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
Who?
Deadline?
Who is the mark?
Um, five.
You want me to pump?
Why?
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
No.  Just the first one.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
About?
No.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Do you think he's here?
In Costa Blanca.
Really?
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
That's right.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
What?
Ten years ago.
What happened?
Ten years later, here you are again.
They're worth less points.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Yes.
It happened to you before?
When did it start?
Uh-huh.
Martin.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
I thought it was interesting --
Would you like a drink?
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Right.
Can I ask you something?
You wish to close this account today?
How to make a buck!
But we are underground?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
Fifteen crowns.
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
That stinks!
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
And put it on expenses?
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Well, don't get carried away.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Close!
So why didn't we?
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
No, We aren't going to do it.
Chris, can you do me a favour?
Chris! Tell me some good news.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Huh?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Now you're using that word.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
And if you're wrong.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
Take this exit.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
No, I love you, really.
But we could go to London and live in England.
I don't understand, it's your home?
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
About forty minutes.
Okay?
And take Jiri with you?
Will this thing take long?
I thought I'd help out.
Seems a shame!
I figured you more as a Socialist?
A champion of lost causes huh?
We_re not all running away
Shall I wash these out?
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
And you broke into that room?
You will wish you hadn't.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
Enjoying our hospitality?
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
I'll need to make a phone call.
We had a deal!
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
When the hell did you write that?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Josh!
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
That's my bag.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
What are you an idiot!
So, who is in the building?
Have you lost all control of this city?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
She's coming over here...
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
Your father dropped off an extra check.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
A late night or an early morning?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
You.
I'm very sorry --
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
Because, growing up, books were my world.
That's deep --
I know you don't want help.
You got some kind of list?
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
You have to believe to have faith.
Oh. Just not at school...
You were great the other night.
I haven't been nice to you.
I don't want to be just your friend --
She great or what?
Your turn.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
What's wr--?
How do you know this place?
When did you build this?
Ergo?
What are you going to -- ?
Jamie --
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
You know how to waltz??
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
But if you could, you would?
I'm asking how much.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
I care for her.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
Now I can do what I want.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Huh?
Then you'll be going to school here....?
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Dad, you seen the drill?
The sunrise? What for?
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
Your line, George!
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
What, am I radioactive or something?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
What?!
Eight thirty.
A gold mine?
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
That's all taken care of.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
Thanks for everything, Pro.
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Gone?... Where?
Oh yeah?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
That's what he told you, huh?
What'd they look like?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Then why'd you do it?
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
Good luck to you.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Hi.
You're a redhead.
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
Are you sure?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
How you doing?
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Don't.
No.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Have you got a better idea?
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
You're my friend, aren't you?
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
You didn't walk out here.
Think I'll take the juice?
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
What?
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
You okay?
Apache?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
What is this thing?  A fighter?
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
And they got Penny!  Look!
Raise your hand...where?
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Another 'you'?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Never.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
Pick those up, Reno.
Pictures don't lie.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Before what?
Barton!
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational–
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
I don't understand-
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Go ahead, son.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
...Barton, is everything okay?
Sound a little what?
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
...I don't guess this means much to you.
...What's the expression – me myself and I.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
I hope these are your shoes.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
...Can I come in?
Barton. Are you all right?
Why don't we go to your room-
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Jesus... You're leaving.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
It's more than I've got.
You'll be back?
...Where did we put him?
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
I – Mr. Lipnik –
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Is this multiple choice?
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Yes, Colonel.
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
How about the coke?
What are you doing here?
Catherine Tramell.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
Who?
What is this interest you've got in her?
What do you want, Nick?
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
Why did you change your name?
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
Did you leave the club with him?
Was there anyone with you last night?
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Why not?
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
My wife used to call me that.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why does he do it?
Why take the risk?
How's your new book?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
What did he say?
Can I talk to you a minute?
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
You still think I kill people, don't you?
I have to do some research tomorrow.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
Why not?
Why?
I finished my book.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Thanks.
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
You think I --
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
Maybe the maid did it.
Keep your three o'clock.
So what do we do -- nothing?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
How old was she when this happened?
I'm a painter, too.
When's your show?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Saddle River, New York!
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ouch..
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
Is Jean Michel here?
No.
MOTHAFUCKAH!
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
I'm not black.
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
You got a date already?
Your people.
We got beat.
You gonna carry that around all night?
Good.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
You're back.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
... babies.
Hi.
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
Don't you think he's using you?
I'll take the whole tin.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Some of them.
No, I'd like the scarf.
I don't eat junk food.
You're a fast mover.
That's a beautiful name. French?
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
It's cold.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
How could you?  I'm a woman...
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
And the truth frightened her?
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
No.  No glass on the inside.
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
I don't.  So, no.
Working late?  I'm touched.
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
I am as well as can be expected.
It's good to see you.
Women.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
I'm on break from-
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
You're loosing your cool
I was just hanging around.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
How did you...?
No sign of the snowman.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
I wouldn't bet on that.
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
You will rescue my wife
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
How about dangerous curves?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
All the answers are numbers.
What do maniacs always want?
Letters in the alphabet.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
What do you know about obsession?
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Fast work. You just moved here.
...Not the bat?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Back off, man.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
I'll show you it works.
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
A-14.
A hit.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Yes?
Where's the boy?
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
GET IN THE CAR!!
What about the girl?
How much do you weigh?
...Not even a 'thank you'?
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
Do you sail?
Odd desire for anyone.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Keep her on the line!
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
We got 'em!
Boss! Jesus! They've --
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Joker here. Can we talk?
... Why the mask?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Alexander... I know you.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Yeeees?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Go ahead.
There were three strawberries.
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Two dollars please.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Say that again, son.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
No!
Of course.
Maybe two cars.
Welsh again.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
So, like, where is she?
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Whoa, my life is cool!
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Cavity search...?
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Chief, look!
Do her? Huh huh.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Cool. Huh huh huh.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
You scored with two chicks?!
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
She's ready.
Oh no.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Wave at the lion.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
I don't think we survived the crash.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
That little girl saw us.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
What happened?
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
I guess we open it.
What time is it?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
What is going on?
So can I?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Wait for who?
Are you available?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Handbook?  When...?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
All right.  Who are you?
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
How'd you do on the science test?
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Three syllables.
I don't know what that signal means.
It's <u>Otho</u>!
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
The attic room is locked --
Answer your mother.
They're... not here anymore.
Are they suffering?
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Is there much more of this torture?
Otho, that's terrible.
They don't want to come down.
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
He does, does he?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
Chauncey!
Your leg must be getting better.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Chauncey...
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Do you like it?
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... Sir?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
What about money?
Some pictures...?
Let's have a look, do you mind?
Please, sir.
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
How were you paid?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Correct.
... In the garden?
You heard?
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Ben!
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Morning.
Which one is Elijah again?
Why'd you do it, Craig?
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Now?
Why?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
You were him last night, weren't you?
And he was with her.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
I need a shower.
My God!
It's Elijah.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
So how was it?
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Mr. Juarez?
Security.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester...
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Why not?
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Hello, Don.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
No.
No. Don't be an ass.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
What kind of circumstances?
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Yes, my dear?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Yeah, I saw them
Who's calling?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Come on in.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
Sleepy suddenly.
Bad dream, darling?
You've got to be kidding.
Yeah what?!
Good-bye, Maxine.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
Your mother all right?
She gone like they say?
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Won't you be late for work?
Morning.
She likes this dress...
No...no...no..
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
You shaved.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Yeah?
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
This is our concern, Dude.
Uh-huh.
Jesus fucking Christ.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
Yeah.
What's this?
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Sheesh.
If what's during league play?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Who has your undies, Walter?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Am I wrong?
What do you need that for, Dude?
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
No.  Here.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
"Johnson"?
Huh?
Excuse me?
You mean coitus?
Oh, no.
Yeah, but what about--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
Finder's fee?
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
What the fuck are you--
So who--
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Hey man--
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Huh.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Have it your way.  The point is--
The what?
...Huh?
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Wooden bridge, huh?
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
That wasn't her toe.
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Uh-huh.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
This driveway.
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Call the medics, Dude.
Well can we--
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Is this a--what day is this?
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
I'm not--
Walter--
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
Where to first?
What is it with you people and pain?
What was that?
Each day is a little life.
Thank you.
You don't want to go there.
You're hurting me.
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
So you're going to do this?
From his father, of course.
Tell me something, Skid --
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
She's been bitten.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
You shouldn't be here.
Why?
How did you know?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
What are you looking at?
Like what?
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
What am I injecting you with?
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Is he sick?
Get out of here --
-- tearing me -- apart.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
Please --
This isn't human blood.
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
We keep in radio contact.
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
Why do you hunt them?
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
Try, please, Anna--
What happened to her, where did she go?
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Why are we here?
Yeah, so?
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Looks like business is booming.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Your body, your call.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Nothing. I dunno--
--like you hurt the baby--
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
I don't know yet.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
So lemme see it.
The witch?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
Get <u>out</u> of here!
--yeah, a hand or something--
Me, too.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Where <u>is</u> it?
Where's Domini?
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
What the fuck--??
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
What--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
What's that?
What'd you see?
Dad...?
Jesus.
You gonna be alright?
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
Spare me.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Why?
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
Your mother's pastor.
Abby. What's the matter?
...Drive me to a motel?
Where... where you going?
...Well I'll be damned.
Uh-huh.
Hello?
...You called me this morning.
Well... what happened?
...That's what's important.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
...So?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
...So what're you doing tonight?
It'll pass.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
What night is it?
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
...What was that back there?
What "what"?
Then what'd you come here for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
Yeah. Is it...
Yeah...
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
...it's too damn risky.
...Count it if you want.
Don't throw that out.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
Thanks Meurice.
Got a problem, Meurice?
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Come into the study a minute.
Why do you do it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
. MOMMY!.
Look at these. What are these?
He's comin' back?. What for?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Don?
Yes.
Who is Don?
Yes.
No. I should go.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
I love you Don with all my heart.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Yeah, it's me.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
What happened to him?
I've gotta go in.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Are you alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
You really want to do this, don't you?
Brilliant.
O.K.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
Who, me? Why should it?
You worry about me really?
You didn't tell him about me?
You want to dance?
Probably not. no. Why?
Are you feeling okay?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
What time are visiting hours?
Well. Okay.
No. you're right.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
No honey, I'm alright.
Que va hacer?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Honey, your nose!
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
The coca is my responsibility!
Mirtha.
What can I do for you guys?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
What the fuck is that?
I don't know...
I don't think so.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
What did I tell you?
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
What's that?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Yeah, I'm out.
I know.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
I'm calling it three.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Barbara.
It's a family heirloom.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
I know.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What are you going to do?
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
You're not going to trial?
Give this to Mom, will you?
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
George.
George.
Jesus Christ.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Where are you going?
Not in front of the kid.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
What?
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
What?
What do you want from me?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
I fucked up.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Stoned?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Are we good?
Nice weed, huh?
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Second name.
Which "district" do you belong to?
What "group"?
You afraid of these ...?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
What ... What must I decide?
Where's Kader?
It's good nobody is following us ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Who is speaking?
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
Are you ready, colonel?
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
I've been waiting for you to get back.
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Take some time off.
You did a good job, Charlie.
An inquiry into what?
So she knew about his heart?
I think I'm going to make your day.
Yeah.
What can we prove?
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
What was the nature of the argument?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Why would she want that?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
She's innocent.
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
I've got work to do.
You've been following me?
How did he look?
Is it Marsh?
She was here?
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
How long were you together?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
Can you give the court an example?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
Why?
What kind of information?
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
October twenty-seventh.
What happened next?
What happened?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
I've been to a few -- yes.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Yes.
Yes.
What do you have in your purse?
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Frank!
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
Is it against the law?
Hello?
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
Really?
You and me -- making love.
You lied to me!
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
You were brilliant today.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Sugar or honey?
You killed him -- didn't you?
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
No -- he's lying.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
I love you.
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
The witness will answer the question.
Can't it wait?
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Yes.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
How bizarre!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Yeah.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Not yet. You want to go?
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Nobody did.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
What do you know about "the changes"?
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Are you from Washington originally?
No, really?
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
Oh there you are.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
He's very... clean.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Is the dizziness gone?
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
Help cook?
Why, do you think?
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Woman friends, too?
Why doesn't it scare you?
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
What were you like when you were younger?
Sleep all right?
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Franny?
Okay.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Oh my God...!
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
It clearly states in the will --
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Don't feed that dog.
Is it true?
Died there?  How?
Are you nuts?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
You soundin' like the old man now.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Jimmy, you've got --
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
Sorry, my brother.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
I can't.  Not yet.
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
Let me see it.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
What are we doing down here?
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
You haven't?
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
Admit what?
The money!
No, Gino!
Gimme the gun.
So, you just got out?
Not bad.  What for?
Caesar, what happened?
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
You mean they weren't up here?
That doesn't make any sense.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
He didn't see you, did he?
I need you ...
Tell them!  Tell them!
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
Violet!
Stupid cunt!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
What did she do to you?
I saved you.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
What?  How about a drink?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
I'm glad you did.
Because it's the truth.
You mean Shelly?
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
You said he washed the money?
Yes.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Gino Marzzone.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
What if he sees you?
There is no going back.
I was so afraid you ...
How'd it go?
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Done.  We go now.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
Jason Bourne is dead.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Who do you think sent me?
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
I needed a break.
We're about an hour away.
I should go.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
Oh, Jesus...
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
Where did this body go?
Tell him we're busy.
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
...ven't you?
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
In fact, killing people -
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Thanks very much Sam.
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Help me!
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Sam!
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
You are late.
Triplets.
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
How much do you know?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Out of kindness.
So what are you going to do about her?
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
How could you do this to me?
Yes.
Stamped?
Where do I get it stamped?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why?
Why not?
Where are you taking me?
What's going on here?
We've got both.
Who is this war against, Sam?
Turn around!
Security.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
What?
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Oh, good!
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
But if they did promote you
A cheque.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Lime, I need to use your computer
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
Mother? Is that you?
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
I mean it fixed itself.
Now look what you've done to him.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
Sign here please.
For God's sake, what's happened?
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
The pace?
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
She wanted something to help her sleep.
I guess I'll be going.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
IB Bangin.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Sure, sure, give go.
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
He's better, isn't he?
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
Five years.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
Promise you won't go inside.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
This is not a good time.
Who is it?
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
Three legs.
Last show of the night.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The brakes are shot.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Do it!
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
Faster! God!
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
Shit, shit, shit...
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
Shut up a second...
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
I don't like being handled.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
You packing up tonight?
Hi.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
Nine seconds.
Well, whatever you think.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Yes.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Yes.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
No.
Do others feel that you did well?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Let's go...
Ready.
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
We came from Washington.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Jane?
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Because...
No...no.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
...good-bye then.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
It's not opinion.
If we could just eat first.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
You okay?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
No.  Did he really?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
I got promoted for things like that.
I don't wan to discuss work.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
Don't you work here?
That's not true I am a sculptor!
If you were an artist you could have created something!
What are you doing here?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
It's kind of dark -
I'm almost ready -
Are you nervous, Walter?
Not even a little bit?
A girl with a body like mine?
Alright we're clear.
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
See you later -
You really like it?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Let's see it.
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
May I please have another little kiss?
It's true, isn't it?
Goodbye.
Of course I do!
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
That's word for word.
Are you trying to be funny?
Murdered...man?...
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
Now what kind of statue was that?
There's that weird dude again.
Man look at that get up !
Man this is heavy!
Walter, what are you doing?
You...made that?
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
H-have a seat?
Hiya Carla.
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Well I'm overjoyed.
Are you done with these?
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
Hello Mayolia.
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
T-tell him that?
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
Figures.
You're the guys from the movie!
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Which way did she go?
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Something like that.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
Hi.
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Well, stay here tonight.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
Hey, Buffy...
Buffy?  What's wrong?
Come again?
I'm going to the dance.
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Leave me alone.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
Let's meet tonight, okay?
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Time to do what?
Everybody does.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Not a pressing issue.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Who we gonna beat?
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
What!?!
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
You are such a wet.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
I want to die.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Pike.
Why?  Why me?
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
Okay, let's go.
I can't believe they still ate it.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
You're kidding.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
I never thought of that.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Smell of booze much.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
So, we're stupid now?
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Just till I lose.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
I knew it--you're seducing me!
What'd he say?
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Don't tell anybody.
Damn.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
What happened?
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
He's a good student.
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
What's that?
You a God damn witch?
Did you call me a cocksucker?
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Why you shaking me off?
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
What do I gotta do?
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm trying to thank you.
Settle what?
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
I'd kill ya.
Well tell 'em, honey.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Ain't here.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
A powerful man.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
No, you're not calm.
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
Okay.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Dad!
Mommy.
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
All right, Ace?
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
No, no it's okay.
Hey, Ace.
You think he got the point?
Just say so.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
You lost your control.
All right.
All right.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
What - what, Caesar's?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
No problem.  Sorry.
Okay. You come by the house?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
You've got to stop her.
It's always been our policy -
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Sam, we got a problem.
Now, he's really pissed.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
I'll be right back.
Okay, thank you for asking.
She took care of the dealers...
What, are you trying to handicap me?
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
Right.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
You're lower than a dog!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
You threw it away?
Why do you want to do that?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Oh...
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I want you to let me go.
Get - Get up! Get up!
I wouldn't -
Just wait there for me!
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Okay, I'll -
Yeah, okay.
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
What expenses?
You gotta go back out there.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Yes.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
Fucker!
Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Is that what you did?
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Artie!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Artie! Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
And I mean... that's no good.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Of course, Remo.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
You got a round figure on it?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Hi, Jennifer.
I can see that. Sure.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
Great.
...same outfit.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
All right.
I'm here.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
We'll go later.
Right.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Hey, how you doin'? 
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
What's the matter with you?
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Yes, uh...
Works for me.
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
How heroic of you...
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
What a "drag."
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Car wash, Captain?
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
Spooky.
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Hey, you're anti-male.
Yeah, she's okay.
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
Good morning.
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Like you don't know...
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
What was that for?
Say something ...
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
You missed.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Lose the hardware now.
Nels?
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
And what're you whispering for?
Don't lay this on me!
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
"Theo?"
26th off Wilshire.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
Does she wear glasses?
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
What's going on?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Or somebody else there is listening in --
What did you do?
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
You timed that beautifully.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
He wants 75 back.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
That's a reasonable possibility.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Know what else is in here?
Five ... six.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
You're making it too easy.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
And then?
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
I'm in awe.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Can I make a quick call?
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
He gave me a look.
Just cut his hair, you know.
He's still looking, Col.
Good thing in a man.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Sure, Dave --
Take your clothes.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Who?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Jimmy.
Hi.
What was that?
You all right?
What was that all about?
You on the game?
He's getting up.
You want me to ask you in, right?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Piss off, Dave!
Would you like a drink?
He was different.
Do you miss him?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
You mean that?
Why?
Why?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
So I'm sorry.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Kind of wish I didn't.
There's Dave. He knew too.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Should have stayed a girl.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
You do something for me, Dil?
You'd do anything for me?
Come on...
What pills?
Died...
Then say it.
And you'll never leave me?
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
Lucky you.
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Do you now.
You don't know that.
Eddie and Tinker died.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Leave her out of this.
Perfect.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Back in a minute, Jody
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
Why do you want to do that for?
He's at home.
And what's she like between the sheets?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
What makes you think that?
No, what's the funny thing?
She'd be anyone's type.
She your wife?
Never.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Now put it back in.
See? I was right about you.
The best.
Do you?
Depends on what you believe in.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Is it bad?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Faster than cricket?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
What?
Not here.
Come and get me, soldier --
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
All right -- where's the letter?
No -- I guess not.
What's the matter?
You don't look so bad in this light.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Now what?
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Oh.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Then how do I know this is your office?
Bartholomew?
What's your first name today?
What now?
Keep going.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Carson Dyle is dead.
You can't.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
What are you doing?
Who told you to do that?
They've got Jean-Louis!
Or Tex?
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Got you.
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
Please keep it.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
About how wealthy would you say?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Voilà what?
But he is gone.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Please, not on my account.
Yes, but we're divorced.
What are you doing here?
Come on. You can't stay here.
We'll find you a hotel.
What was all that?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
I wasn't --
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Peter -- are you all right?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
He knows everything.
Who is it from?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
I don't see him.
Yeah?
Why?
One more time.
Hi Jody.
You said that two weeks ago.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
Ok.
No honey.
What did you hear?
Should we close down any eruption?
Is Jody still awake?
Well?
Did you warn her?
She's not here.
I know where you're going.
Your brother told us.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
Pay no attention to me.
You fucked me up!
You gave me a 'D'.
I am.
You aren't going to the party?
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
Oh nice save.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
You heard about that?
Cut it out.
I got to get home.
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
I heard you got attacked.
Why?
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Lisa Sherman?
What?
Wait.
Who?
On what side of the family?
What?
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Hide your laptop here.
You can't bring it.
I said no.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Rod!
Unfair?!
Stacy?
What, do you work for my boss, dog?

Great. 
That's my business.
Since when does...
He could've called first.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
Go on.
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.

It happens to this piece of shit...
...-ed.
...-er.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
You stole this truck! That's...
...fine.

We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
 

Take your gun!
Oh, shit.

You wanna hit me?
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
Holy shit...
Oh, shit.
Come on, old...
...Shift.
That's right.  Now,  move!

...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
Shut up!


 Go on.
No.  Shit.
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
He's crazy!

You're--?  What?!
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Come on!
Oh, shit!
Okay.
...did you?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...truck.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
A-And you  owe me...

They're takin' off.
Hey, just shut up.
Arlo!  Arlo.

You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Here...
Shoot me. 
All right 
What?

...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.



Stop limpin' around like that.
Who put the big hurt on...
You, Arlo.
You.
Us.  Owes us.
Be cool.  Be--
We're worried...
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...here.   Mason... 
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
You got a prob-...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.


Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
...-lar.
Now listen to me.
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
"I am become Death, the...
...-ple.
...and the government.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...always done, Richard?
"Went away."  I like that.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
Hit him again.

There.
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
I wanna patch in from...
What about these two?
This river ends at a hydro dam...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...should be right outside.
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
I don't see my container.

...and unharmed, de-...

No.
Video lock.
It's after five...
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Geneva just pulled the plug.
No sign of 'em...
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
...like a fish.
...without caution...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
And what if it does?
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
...you, Mason?
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
Mason.  Mason!
...to talk, son.
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
 Listen, Pappas...
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...

Arlo.

Oh.
Do it now.
Negative.  Negative.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
How did she get that idea?
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
We worked in Chinatown together.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
What does this mean?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Sure thing.
In the garage.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
That's a filthy habit.
Then what'll you do?
I'm not.
The apple core?
I'd like to talk to him.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
Or her name?
No. It was an accident.
Isn't that your number?
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Where?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
No.
My husband's at the office.
That's not his apartment.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Yes... why?
Another satisfied client?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Maid's night off?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
As little as possible.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
...No. Why was it.
This morning.
Do? To who?
I can't...
Going somewhere?
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
That's good. Now what's her name?
I said the truth!
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Oh my goodness.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
I'm sorry. We don't.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I said, the northwest valley.
Do you know me?
When it comes.
Yeah.
Gittes?... Gittes?
No problem with me on the Job.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
This?
Apple core?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
What's that, pal?
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Not exactly.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
That's for sure.
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
How's school?
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
Thanks for all you've done for me.
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
Then where's the money?
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.

Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
I might make him nervous.
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Wasted?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
But, Mr. Kane -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Is it good?
We haven't heard from him.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Emily, you -
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
You're very easily amused.
A rooster?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Yes -
At night?
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I won't let you go.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Mr. Leland, you were -
What's this?
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Yeah, all in crates.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
The banks are out of luck, eh?
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
She's plastered, isn't she?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
What's this?
Well, if it's already too late...
It's not the same.
Beats me.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
She said not to come home until graduation.
You can hold me down.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Dick.
So where is he?
Nobody! I swear!
Why?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
You're just going to lock the store like that?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Look how full of yourself you are.
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
Sang.
Then who operated the store?
What about Caitlin?
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
Like you're better!
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Well, he missed!
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
You open?
Seven months.
Five years.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
All four?
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
What's that?
How do you mean?
I guess.
More or less.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
No.
Because you buckled.
Don't yell at me, pal.
Pull my laces tighter.
What!?
Shit. What about tomorrow?
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
Broke his neck.
Stop it.
He made it, hunhh?
I can't fucking believe you!!
Her fucking body fell out!
Let me borrow your car.
I want to rent a movie.
Jesus!
Please, get the hell out of here.
Get to work.
I like to expand my horizons.
No way!
You're kidding.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
You should shit or get off the pot.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Am I right or what?
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Make them change.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
How's your eye?
To talk to you.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
Go open the video store.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
The porno mags?
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
You're kidding.
What were you doing?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
Three?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
All right. Name it.
What do you mean?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
What did he say?
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
Here you go.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
I didn't do that!
No way!
What did he say?
What part of Russia?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
I think the lady called it.
Feel that.
Really?
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Like hell you are!
Willam!
I will. Take it easy.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Did you catch that thunder?
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Go on, fetch.
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Can I count as fast as I like?
The winds are picking up.
Hello, Gabriel.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
I know...
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
I can't believe you just said that.
It was great.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
What was God thinking when he built this place?
No luck?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
Gabe!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Just kidding.
What about you?!
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
What the hell are you doing--
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Why didn't you send the money over?
What's the delay?
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
You got what we need?
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Great, sir. Great.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Yes. They want to help.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
Hullo.
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
What would you like to know, sir?
You've not been to school all week, son.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Fine, fine.
What do I want?
I'm gonna be sick.
Yes, sir.
Blue eyes?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Something like that.
How are you feeling today?
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Good. What do you want?
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
Fucking hell...
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Yeah... Pete the English.
D'you think we should do something?
Hullo, son, how are you?
Sixth is faster.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
Where are you, what floor?
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
No.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
What kind of question?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
What?  What did you say?
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
Something going on?
You guys been holding hands?
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
Hi, Ma.
I'm standing right here.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
He'll keep calling.
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
We have a deal.  What's your name?
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
What are you doing?
You said you were visiting friends!
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
Who's that?
So what?
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
You go every night?
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Who's Heller?
It's what I do for a living.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
What happened?
They said send you downstairs.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
I never told her.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
You going to warn him?
You think I'm crazy.
I better get going.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
Yes.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
That was him.
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
What is it?
We're going to Queens?
Now what?
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Then tell me what happened.
Back where?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
I love you, too.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
And you have no idea where he lives?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
So, you doing anything tonight?
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Yes.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
Agent Lowry.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
He died...  ... in 1972.
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
I disagree.
Pepsi?  Tequila?
You know why I'm here.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
What is it?  What's happened?
Do you have a minute -- ?
You...
What does it say?
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
What?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
Here, right around Centaurus A.
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
Could we hear God?
Pensacola.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
Why don't you come back with me?
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
I'd say this is slightly different.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
We could be together again --
But the work --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
You sonofabitch.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
That you, Valerian?
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
I don't think so.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
So.  The final countdown.
But --
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
Oh my God...
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Lookit her bounce.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Here's the Patrol.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
A cold drink.
That's my baby.
Well, whatta we got here?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Where'd the road go?
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
What you mean, Luke?
But, Luke...
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
He'll never make it.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
I thought he was lying.
I was?  How you spell that?
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
The door was already open...
She's supposed to have it.
Hello, Daryll Lee.
What book?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
We've got another one.
Is that it?
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
The lock...
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
Michael Johnson.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
I heard. Good police work.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Where you going?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
He's not treating her right...
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
There, that's better.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
So - why the airport?
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
Crash victim?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I want to see my mother immediately.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
What's up with you?
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
Yeah, everything's under control.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
How can I help?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
What do you think?
But what am I going to do?
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Ruth's already taken him home.
I'll see you soon.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
Chair, cup and ball.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
He asked me to marry him.
For a price.
No.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
Shocking, huh?
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
Hey.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Who ever said sanity was fun?
What is it? Are you OK?
Silly, silly, silly.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I sure know what that feels like.
I love you so much.
Yeah?
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
Where are the tapes?
A pass.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Okay.   How much?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Someone else coming?
Uh, no --
Why didn't you tell me about this?
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
Tonight?
For what?
Why not just steal another one?
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
Turn on the flashlight.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
All right, knock it off.
Anybody hungry?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
I'm from Belgium.
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
Everything.
The map said to go left.
There has to be.
They don't have a wine list.
No, I didn't.
They don't serve wine here.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
I'll drive.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
No.   It's mine.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
The money isn't here.
You're not helping.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
Who's gonna see it there?
Sounds boring.
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Where's your master?
Go ahead.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Put them down.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You're not married, are you?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You know about Lo?
Let's end this here.
Never!
You shouldn't have come.
Let's stop a moment.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
But the sword could be in his compound.
No onions though, okay?
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
It's just the dope, don't worry
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
What's going on...?
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
Well, how's your friend?
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Cute nickname, don't you think?
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
How the hell did you do that?
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Miss her?
Get it?
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
We've got company.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
I'm Kathryn.
Have we met?
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Are you okay?
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Got a boyfriend back home?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
You've read The Fountainhead?
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
I sincerely doubt it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
How's the water?
Thank you.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
You're naked.
It was fine.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
That's also none of your business.
No, not at all.
What are you reading?
Sure. Have a good night.
What?
You know what? I don't take it back.
I just came to say goodbye.
How am I a hypocrite?
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
German.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
The football stud?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
He made you give him a blow job.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
It's like a secret society.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
Want a blow job?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Hi, mom.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
What do you mean?
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Sorry.
Why not?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
You can put it anywhere.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Any day now.
Who are you calling?
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You didn't?
Oh come on. For her first time?
Some other time.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
To my triumph, of course.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
Well please leave a message that I called.
She's not here.
I'll do that.
I said, do you want some water?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
What are saying, darling?
Did you ever make a wish?
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Where'd you get this, darling?
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
Where is everybody?
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
You're shouting at me.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
But I told her to go with you.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Hello, Amy.
Where did you mail them?
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
Why didn't you run after them?
Now Amy
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
Daddy?
What'd you get for Christmas?
Who are you?
But where do you come from?
Will you be friend for always?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Oh, how beautiful!
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
But I only came to give back the ring.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Hide me? Why?
Let the child stay.
On the dark nights — on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Wow your body's really hot.
How have you been feeling?
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
Or if there's a full moon.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
What? Why the hell did he do that?
And then?
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Get rid of him!
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
You're such a good friend.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
Fall in love.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
I think George knows.
I do development for TV movies.
You're kidding, really?
You hungry?
My apartment's just such a mess.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
Oh, it's nothing.
It's stupid.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
Like what?
What are they for?
Uh.... hi!
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Your breasts feel larger.
Hello?
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
I ate a guy last night.
We can get a warrant if you like.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
It's for you. Frida.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
What are you talking about?
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
How long have you been here?
They don't speak English...
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
It seems fine.
How can I submit this?
People...  after me.
Don't know that either.
Such a joker!  Like your father.
I see.  The verdict, yes...
I didn't realise...
Horrible...
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
Why?
What is it?
They barely talk anymore.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
Right and don't embellish.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Dave...
The Washington Post.
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
.. Nothing.
What do you think you're doing?!
Oh... I'm fired?
You're fired.
Till what?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
We think so.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
What about the wife?
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
And who's gonna find out?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
What happened?
In the car.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
What do you mean you made it all up?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
What are they?
They re not my attack dogs.
You ever use it?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
What's that?
Didn't mean to bum you out.
Who?
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
What?
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
How were you gonna get home?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
What?
That's a secret.
Yes.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
They're crucifying you out there.
You really believe that?
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
Please....shoot me.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
What'dya get?
How was dinner?
Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
I don't know.  I don't get it.
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Well...
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Oh God, it's over now!
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Mr. Keating!
Yeah?  Like what?
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Hey, he's your roommate.
You what?!  How did you do that?
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Well, sure!
Knox, I don't believe this!
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
I have to go home. Chet might call.
Yes sir.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
LOUDER!
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Where are you going?
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
But father, it's not fair.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
You know me, always taking on too much.
What is this, a midnight study group?
What?
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Er  No.
From you?
Todd, what's the matter?
It's not going to help us!
Who?
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Not an option.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Now look what you did!
Unless you collected on the insurance...
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Got it?
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
Finnegan...
How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
It's okay...come on...
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Man, don't go up there...
Or maybe not.
Why don't you back off?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Someone's back there.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked us both.
Fuel up. Need fuel.
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Yes, Albert?
Nick's going?
Here's to huntin'.
Ammo! Get the ammo!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
They did too!
I thought that was it.
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
That's new, isn't it?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
No, I --
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Hey, Nick...
Where's it gone?
Not so good.
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Frost.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
Who the hell is he?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
You do?
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Nick, he just came back.
Pow?
I thought you might be praying.
Forget Sal.
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
I like it, Nick.
No.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Great. That's great.
Great. Hey. That's great.
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
Did you get one?
It's Merle, Sal.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
Up I would say... What would you say?
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Yeah?
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
Hello Wade.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
I want to stop aging.
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
I don't want to hear anymore.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
You sure?  I can help you.
Are you a cop?
I have to go home, Sanchez.
Wanna come?
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Hey, I'm eating.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Rip Van Winkle.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You should be in hospital.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Hi.
You could always take it off.
I'll take it.
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
But I like the new one better.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Say ... about the interest ...
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
No, no! Give it to me!
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
Dan'l Webster?
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
How much?
Jabez -- help!
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
Well -- what are we going to do?
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Jabez!
Worried!
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Mary --
Why don't they come --
Helps sometimes to say it.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
What's that you say, Son?
Ma -- is she? --
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
My son ... what's the matter?
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
It is.
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Just someone from New Hampshire!
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Me?
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
The code key, please...?
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Three down, four to go --
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Powell?  What's going on?
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Is that him?
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
Jesus, you're the man!
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
Yeah...
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
I know!
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
I don't have a choice.
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
He's makin' threats in there.
Yeah.
You alone, or you got confederates?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
What?
Calm down, you're not ...
The girl hostages.
What the hell you doin' back there?
What the fuck do you want?
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Yeah ...
I want to talk to him.
We're all set at Kennedy.
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
You got kids?
Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
Do you think we can turn it on?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
Are you a lawyer?
How did you know your son was involved?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Because I don't want cancer.
Ah, Jesus...
Goddamn women...
I want him to think that.
To show that we're negotiating.
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
Sonny -
I never been up in a plane before.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Oh - Maria!
Hey, you okay?
Fuck!  We did it!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
Of course not ...
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
What is it, Choco?
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
So what?
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Okay.
I've already formulated a plan.
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
Is that the decoder?
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
Really? Did you play in a band?
How did you meet Choco?
Cool it, Choco.
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
Many times.
We're covered on legal with that, right?
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
<i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i>
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
I'm gonna leave now.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
No, you the man.
Make it plain.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
No.
I'll see you out.
Nice!
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
Let it be broke.
It's dug.
ML?
Hey!  What did I say?
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
I would like to get paid now.
C'mon, Sal.
Whatdafuck do you want?
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Tina, you are too slick.
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
Why you gotta curse?
Feels good.
Where are you going?
Just coolin'.
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
I don't know.
I'll do that.
That's the dope.
Some are OK.
I know this.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Pino, relax, will ya.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
But I came here to learn about America.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
What are you wearing?
Hey look, it's our teacher.
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
Wow just like Marco Polo.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
No no no no no.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Whoa. What was that?
Your mom made a move on me.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
No.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
Nice jugs.
You're it.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
According to the map, we're just about at school.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
But-
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
George Washington!
If you have to ask, you don't know.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
Well, I'm listening now.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Ready Lloyd?
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
You had some questions.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Why ith dat newth?
Yes, what?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
So, when can we do it?
What are you doing?
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Sure.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I think you did it.
I'm not sure if I can do this.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
You said "aloha" twice.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
So what do you keep in there?
Oh, just like the President.
My thanks.
What happens now?
I can assure you...
So, this is Leto the Just...
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Remove her gag!
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
Man-carved steps.
Stop him yourself.
Always?
Liet?
Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
Uh, beg to differ.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
But you're a big star!
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
Bela, what happened?!
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
You'll be sitting on the right.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Why are you here??
Don't you have any savings?
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
You really think so?
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
I don't understand.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
No!  A horror movie star!
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
I'm going to my mother's.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Dolores, wait!
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
Could we moovf to table?
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
My eyes are killink me.
What is happening?
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Can I help you?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
Lugosi?
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
Did you find it boring?
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
You know, to make the legs move --
Wow.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
They celebrated the common person.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
How's your mother?
Did you see that?
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
Sure.
Yeah.

Al!
You know who we are?
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
No. It's a mess.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
How's Marcia? She all right?
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
He had girlfriends!
She could've been a nurse.
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
Eddie...
What happened?
What?
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
What's going on over there?
Right, yeah --
Hi, Mom. 
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
Hey, Lou.
Really?
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
So...?
Page three of the Post.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I'm sorry.
Where?
Okay.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
Kinda'.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
What's up?
I'm making a tape.
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Good-bye, brother!
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
That girl's an idiot.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
How?
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
You're kidding, right?
Larry?
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Tracy.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Yes?
What do you mean?
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
Hello, Mr. M.
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Plenty of pep, too.
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
What's this?
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Hmm?
So... what do you have to tell me?
Which door?
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
points at the motel.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Yep.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
And she's super-nice
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
These are private -- these are for us.
Who put you up to this?
Thought what?
Hell, good luck!
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yeah.
Can I sign yours too?
Yes, Paul?
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Now could you leave me alone?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
How'd she meet Patchett?
Did they deserve it today?
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
Was it... a rat?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Bud...
You wanted to meet here?
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
More or less.
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
Damnit...
Glasses.
I need to speak to you.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
What's that for?
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
What are you going to do?
Lynn Bracken.
No.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
How was I?
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
Working whores with squad two.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
I'm doing a transfer now.
I'll come straight there.
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
It is?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
You knew the deal. No contact.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
I mean did you call anyone.
What'd I tell you?
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
None of your business.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
What do you think?
What the fuck?!
Drive.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
That's fine.
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
I'll be right back.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
You tell me.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
Hey.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
Who did you work with to get the--
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
I know.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
I was missing you.
They're saying you killed that policeman.
My suitcase--
Is this a fuckin' joke?
You don't know who the fuck--
Actually, that's not true.
DePinto?
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
I gotta go.
You being audited?
I'm gonna fix it.
What makes you think it's you?
You're a moron, you know that?
He didn't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Your shoe.
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
Bobby--
I don't under--
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
No.
Ssh!
They killed Rachel.
I don't know. I mean--
I don't know!
Jerry--
You gotta--
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
Are you okay?
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
It means who's side are you on?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
What happened?
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
If they've looked at the video.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Yes?
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
Then let's assume I don't.
Now is that clear?
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
That insults them.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Shall we be all right?
Will you not come in?
Will you please come in?
I'm impressed you can sew.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
I'm sorry, Katharine.
What kind of photographs?
Very well.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
Good morning!
Do you have your papers, sir?
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Is this you?
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
What do you want?
Yeah, for a while.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
What if I told you he did this to me?
Where did you find that?
I think that's called looting.
Oh, all over.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Is it you?  If I said Moose… I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
He's Canadian.
He needn't disturb you.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
Arguing about books.
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
Kip - come and dance with me
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once… He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Pardon me?
You've got a mustache.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Yessir.
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almásy looks uncomfortable.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
Kip?
You ordering chop suey again?
And the draft blew over the flowers.
That's doable.
I can't?
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
You're not taking me seriously.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
I know.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
It's a test.
How much am I paying?
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
What the hell do I do now?
Motorcycle.
I don't believe this.
And good morning.
Nice spot.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
On what? Another job?
Let's do it again.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
That's it. We're ready.
Won't take any time.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
Can you see the other PIRs?
Okay, you're a thief.
What?
You've got everything planned.
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
Peoples China Bank.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
So how long till we do this?
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Four billion dollars.
Not for me.
The door's the only way out!
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
You two make quite a couple.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
Whoa.  Remind me.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
There's more than one?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
Five million dollars?
And get someone to help around the house.
I'm sorry, Erin.
You never called me back.  I left messages.
You're a girl.
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
And you can't?
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
Is that what I think it is?
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
Counts?
Why good?
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
Two million dollars?
And you were told to destroy those?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Pattee?  That your middle name?
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Mommy, can I get a flower?
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Yeah.
Can I play roller hockey?
She's one of the sick people?
Which number do you want, George?
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Cause I don't even know you.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
What are you doing here?
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
What time is it?
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Where's my paycheck?
What?
There's something else, too.
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
It'll be fine, yeah.
Wow, that's soon --
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Soon, Lord Vader.
He can do it.
... Like we're being watched.
I'm looking for someone.
Yeah ...
I'm looking for a great warrior.
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Mine, mine.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
Yes, Your Highness?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
We've got to get out of this shower.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
What are you afraid of?
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
That depends.  Where are we?
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
He found him in a junk pile ...
I was worried about you.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
Probe?  What probe?
How's your mining operation going?
Get out of here, Lando!
I'll take what's mine now.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
We've got to find Luke.
What?
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
You rest now.
A tremor!
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
This hyperdrive had better work.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
I can't. It's too big.
I don't believe it.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
I see a city in the clouds.
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
With food?
What are they doing here?
We shall want a full autopsy ...
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
Give it.
I need a favor.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
All right, so I made another deal.
I'm already dead.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
See you in hell, Snake.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
Get this crap out of me.
Defense against what?
Plissken...?
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Where are they?
Not yet.
How do you know all this?
I don't know about this thing.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
Arthur.
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
He can be no other.
Who is Merlin?
Whose son am I?
I want to thank you.
Yes.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
But, I'm here.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
And you cannot love me...
Why?
Me?
There are things about love--
Very well. Climb up.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
It is.
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
The oath. You didn't say--
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
What honey?
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
It's-
Here.
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
Phonograph.
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
Groceries maybe? A package?
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
A man to see you.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
A stimulant.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
She used those words?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Are you sure?
Did he tell you about my party?
He didn't mention?
On what?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Did you know my mother died recently?
She...killed Burke Dennings.
What did you do today?
You've been playing with it?
Mr. Dennings?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Well your thinking's not so good.
People get tired.
Oh my God!
I don't want it.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
Do you like films?
Withering Heights.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Where's Regan?
You'd like that?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
You and Regan?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
I'm all right.
Save your servant
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Who?
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
No.
Give me the keys!
Frankie.
What's this?
What're you saying, Charlie?
Beasley.
What's our friend's problem?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
What do you think?
Seeing anyone in particular?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
What're you talking about?
What was it like?
Sure, why not.
That's what we agreed.
Jack.
Get out of here.
Just a lucky guess.
Very realistic.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
Why would I mind?
What?
What's the matter with you?
Couple years.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
We're not getting paid then.
Nothing. We get nothing.
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
Stay off it.
Fuck you.
I didn't hear you come in.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
How're your hands?
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
So what'd you think?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Uh... he knows it.
What do you mean?
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
When?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
That!  You can't wear that!
Come on.
A seven.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Nine!
What do you think?
Shoes?
Maybe it's legit.
You two could play checkers.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Virgins?
He's right.
Hey, we're connected.
You're kidding me.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Brought it.
Don't worry about it.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
You never sang before?
Fucking.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
Forget it.
Aren't the kids asleep?
So why's he do it?
What's that supposed to mean?
Nina?
Friend.
History.
The both of them?  In there?
He had a mind that escalated things.
So ... ?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Jack.
Guess they're up.
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
How do you know?
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
How'd the show go?
From Hurley's?
So. How are you?
Big piece or little?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
... I was dreaming ...
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Who is this?
How did he expect to do that?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Go on.
Now what?
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
What are you going to do!
They're too tight.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Commander, what are you doing here?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
You merciless bastard!
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
You'd have to start immediately.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
What is with you tonight?
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
Adelle?
Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
Why Jack?
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Take you, for instance...
...that’s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Excuse me?
Rise...and...shine...!
We’re almost done here...
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Where do I go now?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Trouble at work?
Damn...
Hey Jack, you’re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
She is relentless.
She said that?
So Jack, it’s your wife’s birthday, got anything to say to her?
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Yeah?  What do you need?
Miss me, Jack?
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You’re making a business deal...
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
Are we...?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
Are you okay?
Jack...don’t even start...
Look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You’re not wearing that to the Thompsons’ party. I don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
What are you doing?
She’s your dog, Jack.
Wait a second.  You want me, don’t you?
Thanks, Jack...
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
No?
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
C’mon.
You want the cake!?
Thank you...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
It’s been interesting, that’s for sure.
I promise, Jack...
Kate...
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Peter Lassiter...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
No...I’m not...
Hey, my wife’s in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
I mean...
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
What the --!
We're working as hard as we can --
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
Where...where am I?
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
He's not responsive --
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
You're hot!
Me like-y.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
How's the IPO?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
<u>Ben</u> did this?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
Okay to proceed.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
Trip? Where to?
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Yes, Alan.
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
He's making a fine recovery.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
Look at that...they're changing color...
You must carry spare parts --
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Doctor, we've just about had it.
Tell them to take us out.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
You have no right to blame Duval --
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
Looks like somebody declared war.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
What'd you do that for?
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
Come on -- it's no use!
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
That's it...
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
Well, okay, it's -
Okay.
...Blood has been shed.
We need more -
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
Yah, okay, but, uh -
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Yah, he -
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Just a general way.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah.
Uh-huh.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
A subconscious-type thing.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Yeah, but -
Yah, but -
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Well... yah.
Yah!
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
...Dad?
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
You're darned tootin'!
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
I'll fix ya some eggs.
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Yah?
Linda.
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Hon?
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
They announced it?
Your mallard?
It's just the three cent.
Yah, I guess.
And his wife?
The first rule of Project --
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
You are a moron.
Cornelius!  How are you?
No.  I found something new.
Is that your blood?
Hmm?
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
You're kidding.
I'll take the parasites.
I want that.
Looks like this is goodbye.
How did you find me?
Look, this is a bad time...
This could go on for hours.
No, thanks.
When?
That... sawing and hammering.
Guy or girl?
Yeah?
Is this a trick?
Is that what you're calling it?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
What did you say... ?
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Why are you doing this?
My God, you're shot...
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
How have you been?
Is this a test, sir?
You were in here last Thursday night.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
What do you do, Tyler?
What?
I guess so.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
I don't follow...
I don't know about this.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Same here.
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
What are you reading?
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
You're okay with this?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
What are we doing?
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
This conversation...
"Applicant?"
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Is this really news to you?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
Yes...
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Damn it!  God-damn it...
Why... why... why... ?
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
What are you doing?
Appreciate something.
Look at me...
Abort the plan.
Robert Paulson?
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Take a guess.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
What's going on here?
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
What on Earth are they doing?
Mom?
Is that something you're "feeling?"
4:25.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
You know what to do.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
Fag.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
I'm sorry we broke in.
And don't pass on the right.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
It broke!
Knock it off!
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
You okay?
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
What's that?
That guy's not going to make it.
You never been in one of those things.
Where did you find this clown?
Thanks.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Look, Co...
What was that?
Stay on your heading, Captain.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
How long before you're fully on line?
Black.  No sugar.
I know...
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
Who're you?
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
I... You're not going to understand this.
Hello....congratulations.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
No.
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
How un-sixties of you.
Free?
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Have I died?
<u>What</u>?!
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
SAW WHO!!?
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
Happily married, probably.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
I advise you to let us go.
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
Are you all right?
How do you know him?
I never say anything I have to.
I don't drink coffee...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
Now, now.
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
You just going to sit there?
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
Sure...
What's your name?
Alaska.
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
You want me to hold the chicken.
Wasn't it, ladies?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
I just can't look at you.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Maybe you better stay, then.
It's not that bad.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Where is she, anyway?
Bye, now.
Hello...
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
Why?
Wait...
No inner feeling.
I have to talk to you.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Well...
Don't call me "mack," honey.
You better hold onto your tongue!
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Miss Dupea.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
What?
Yo.
A play-ya.
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Fa what?
Wha'?
What are you going that way for?
Yo! What you goin' for
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
Yo, that's my girl.
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
God I admire you.
Would you like me to change anything?
Wonder who his supplier is.
You're lucky.
Fletch F. Fletch
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Margaret.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
Like when?
Jesus.
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
You're in the Records Room.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
That's it.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
Read this, please.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Right.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
I'm the Sufi.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
We can't talk about it here.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
Yo!
Shoot.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Thanks.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
That's a strange combination.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Why do you keep doing this?
Hi.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
You ordered it here?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
No.
You can't do that.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
They just left, sir.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Your call is come through.
The door was unlocked.
No wonder.
Where is she?
Tell the cops.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Who?
You're onto something. That's good. What?
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Fletch, you want an apology?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
But I ain't got you...
Actually, you may take it all now.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
You wish.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
What an interface!
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Hello?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
My axe!
This is boring, guys.
Ford, you were right!
This way...
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
I can't kill this kid's father...
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Ouch.
I'm sorry...
So, did you find my dad?
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
What's fine?
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
The point?
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
Well, hello, Ford.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
What about Don?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
This isn't music!
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
What's my name?
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Got a wife named Angie.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
Man, I'm clean.
Did they follow you?
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Are you sure it is dead?
It's beautiful.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
There's nobody like that on six.
Des Moines.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
When ya go back on?
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
Why not?
What happened to you?
You want the red or the white?
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Timezit?
Hey, Bo.
It was a crematorium.
Yeah.
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
They around?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
How do we get to the vault door?
Damn.
You give him his drops?
I love you, Bud.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
About what?
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
I'm scared.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What the hell...
Oh my god.
What are you talking about?
On the job?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
Yeah, it's me.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
What?  What is it?
Whatta you mean she's not here?
What are you talking about?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
Got it.
What are we like in...1998?
Yeah, you betcha.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
What?
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
How you feeling?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
Hell-
Sullivan?
Breakfast?
How about a roll in the hay?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Which one is it?
Derek... stop.
This is too painful to look at.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
What do you mean?
Why did you come back here?
You know him?
Got any good ideas?
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
I never said you were "nothing".
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
...And I said, shut up!
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
Okay, give it back.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
So what happened?
That's debatable.
Which is?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Eight times.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
Steven...
Look, I don't want your money!
Legs giving you trouble?
What's the problem here?
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
Why did you want her body?
Does he know about what happened?
It was a community service.
What are you doing?
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
About Jessica.
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
No thanks.
Right.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Where's the radio?
What's that?
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
I doubt very much that one even exists.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
Did you have an accident in the lake?
I've got the numbers.
Can he really take us home?
You have to call the police...
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
Guys ready to order?
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
Don't talk like that.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
And he was there?
You say we go?
We're making too much of this.
He'll hate it.
Had to be him.
Great game.
This could be it.
This could be it.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
It's your best play, Nicky.
She is kicking you out.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Opening night?
What will we talk about?
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
Why won't you tell me your name?
What else?
What else?
What do we want?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
See, Daddy.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
I am really, deeply sorry.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
Life is true.
Who is it?
What do you want?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
A grandmother. God bless you.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Now that's a complicated subject.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
Then say it.
Because life is good.
Don't worry. It's a test.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
Game six is history,pal.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Mine was cobalt blue.
Yes.
Say it again.
You know what.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
Is it true?
But you're his friend.
No one's waiting.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
What? Come on, Paisley.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Oww!
Please! You're being foolish!
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
That was lucky.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
What was he like?
What'd he say?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
It's beautiful.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
You mean a general strike?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
They're sparing no one, I see.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Perhaps some tea?
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
That's the last.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
From what budget?
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Hello.
Suit yourself.
German.
I have to know where you come from.
You really need that much?
Who died?
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
Come on--we're taking off.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
How was your evening?
Everybody goes there.
Will you be okay?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
Hello?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
Vincent...Vincent...
You can wear lifts.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Why don't we say we were together?
Where?
You didn't know?
I envy you, Jerome.
So you didn't do it after all.
I can't.
What happened?
What is it?
What are you doing?
All it takes is a long arm.
I'll take care of my end.
Hello, McCoy.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
Where do you want to go?
It doesn't look like that.
Just like old times?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Where did you get them developed?
Half a million.
How does it taste?
How was it?
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
$250,000 right off the top.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
Promise you won't laugh.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
I mean it.
What about the bank?
How long ago.
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
Do you mean that?
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
What?
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
How much?
Are you hungry?
No scars?
Things can't get much worse can they?
Can we make it?
What is it?
Are we going to make it?
That certainly makes you kind of special...
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
All right. Shells?
Gonna knock down a wall?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
What do you have in mind?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Let's just get to the border.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
I got a nurse in mind.
I've got to stop.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Oh ay?
I made a mistake.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
That's not good enough.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Who paid you to see me off?
No, don't Jack, don't.
Everyhing go off all right?
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
How were things between you and Frank?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
I call that regular.
I know him too.
We went about together.
Yes, while he was here.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
What kind of entertaining?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Did my brother Frank find out?
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Have another?
Oh, what you doing now?
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
What you having, Jack?
Nowt.
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
What happened to you, then?
Did they give you a rough time?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Ta.
I'll call the police.
What'll they do to him?
They bloody hurt me.
So shut up.
You wouldn't.
No chance of that.
What you going to do?
You coming back?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Oh, that's nice.
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Scotch, please.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
You're not seeing me?
They did.
It's too...
I, I...I...
It's not.
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
You...
...you're absolutely right.
They have...
Should do something to them.
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
As an idea.
No.
Did I say that?
He'd give me a job.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
In the abstract...
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Clear...
Everything I...you know...
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
A waste of time?  Why?
The cops?
They aren't?
Yes.
You have nothing to hide.
They're inured to it.
Will you excuse us please?
Did the leads come in yet?
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Moss...Who told him?
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
You have a problem?
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
...no...
Under him?
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
...you talk to Murray...
Yes.
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
John.  John...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
Why?
Of what?
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Alright.
Can't do it.
Is that what you're saying?
What happened?
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
How do you know I made it up?
No.  It hadn't.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
I've got the check...
Don't.
Why?
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Eight units?
When?
How was it...?
"Always be closing..."
Harriett...
You closed 'em today?
Oh, Christ.
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
The monthly interview...?
I'm sorry...?
Rick...?
Rick...?
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
Who did she call?
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
You don't count Saturday.
I'm...
What power?
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
Fuck you.
What is this, your farewell speech?
You closed him yesterday.
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
Three?  I count two.
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Did you see my present for you?
Why do you have to go?
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Would you like some?
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
I understand...
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
The 'patrone' is here.
He's not the same as when I met him.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
Where's my wife?
What do you mean gone?
You're going to talk to him now.
Will you tell him?
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
Go on, tell me.
Was it a boy or a girl?
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
They are everywhere!
Good.  Then you're staying.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
I had no idea...
Why don't you sit down?
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
Enjoy.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
On the phone?
He don't want to talk?
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
I'm talking about Italians!
He supports me.
What's this?
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
I accept your generosity...
What's that mean?
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
Then you're as single as I am.
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
What have you done with him?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
Do you mind?
Is this David's doing?
Does that surprise you?
Everybody has stories to tell.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
This was World War I?
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
It's not like her.
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Storm's getting worse.
No.  It won't do.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
Did I hurt you?
Need some help?
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
You coming, Boone?
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
It's been a long time, Memphis --
It seems she neglected to mention it
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
You want to come along quiet?
And this has what to do with me?
I know you.
What's wrong with it -- ?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
What for?
You seem a little hinked-up ...
Got it ...
What about him?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
Most of 'em are late-model...
How's it going -- ?
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
Any word, Kip -- ?
How you know that?
Why didn't you tell me?
He's in some trouble ...
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
You goin' home?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
You all right -- ?
You sure you're okay -- ?
Nah. It's a scratch.
Hey, you want something to eat ?
He's gonna kill you -- !
You?
What era was that -- ?
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Now what -- ?
You know of one -- ?
Buy you a drink?
What the hell are you doing -- ?
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
No ... ?
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
So, you seeing anybody?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
Unlock your button ...
The alarms go off ...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
Where to -- ?
This time it's for real?
Is he still working here ?
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
You need him...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
You know what you got here?
Why don't you leave him alone?
What did you hear about that thing?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
I'm gonna need some money.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
Who's gonna do that?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Keep 'em coming.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
I better call again.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
Are you okay? What happened?
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
He didn't call?
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Chuckie, what the fuck happened?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
What class?
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
Oh, right.
Okay.
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Yah, that is a nice ass.
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Did she get my Double Burger?
Morgan, Let's go.
Some other guy?
Did your Uncle get arrested?
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
What's up guys?
What class did you say that was?
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Okay. How?
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
What are you smiling at?
Yes.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
So who won the bet?
Sean.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
And he mailed it to Hardy--
I got it.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Why would he do that?
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
You moved?
Seems like it's going well.
Jobs doing what?
He married his cousin.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Sean...
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
What should I do?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
You're right. I know.
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
What does?
What is?
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
No.
Yeah? You got a lady now?
Well, are you going out again?
My wife's dead.
Why not?
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
The wrench, why?
I'll keep in touch.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
I really don't 'date' that much.
No I wasn't...
I swear to God.
I want to meet them.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Why do we always stay here?
How's it goin'?
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Will? Are you awake?
Come with me to California.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
What about your twelve brothers?
Take care.
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
Ready, Ma?
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Lots must a died, too.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
Short fella. Pale face.
House 25. Number's on the door.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
That's the way it is.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
And you ain't ashamed?
But we can still do it, honey.
Sure do.
What's the matter? What's happened?
I never asked you!
How 'bout Granma?
Where you going?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
We gonna live here?
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Pa! Shh!
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
How about it, Ma?
When?
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Looks like you done it.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
What's this?
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
You do not.
What do you do?
You do not.
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
What am I gonna do?
I just play my own collection.
How long has it been?
Tell me about yourself.
Are you going to the reunion?
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Watched television?
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Do you want to get a drink first?
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Will you come with me?
Say more.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
Like a union?
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
No deal.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
Did you see Blank in there?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
Enough?
What's a revival tent?
You have a headache?
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Of course you will.
So what happened to you?
No. You drove us here.
How are you? How's business?
How's that?
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Doesn't matter.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Yeah.
Why didn't it work out?
Ever think of moving there full time?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
You missed a button.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Oh, honey... What happened?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Would you like to see that?
How long is this going to go on?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Did he tell you that?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
What are you talking about?
Started what?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
Great!
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
It's me.
That bag's almost empty.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
What if she doesn't want to go?
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Was the trip okay?
It's so cruel.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
You don't seem to upset?
What?
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
When you figure on branding?
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Why do you always wear that hat?
She gonna be long?
Mmm. An editor.
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
I can't... not yet...
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
I thought your mom's coming up?
You want to watch some television?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Hey, darlin'.
You're looking fit.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Well, that'll happen.
You think it's cool?
Secret Service!
How's it going, Ray?
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
What's that?
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
What?
Damn!
One-handed!
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Yeah?
And what's he do?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Yes!
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Make it our first date.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
Why did he come to you?
Shit!!
Ready?
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Excuse me.
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
You're welcome.
Mr. Belford?
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
What? whatwhatwhat?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
What is he doing in here?
Any questions?
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
So what are we supposed to do?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Murphy kid turn you down?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Thank you.
So?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
Brady!
Shit!
Go!
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
Honey, I don't think their home.
Why shouldn't I?
Four plus Myers.
Now where are you going?
I do.
Watch it.
Who you calling?
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
What the hell did this?
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Jamie, wait for me.
Had enough?
Rachel come on.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
You look sharp. You understand?
Oh Christ. Doc...
It's over.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Saving the treats for Bob?
I don't see anything.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I'm scared.
Yes.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
You idiot!
I wonder where they went.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
Fantastic. Totally.
I gotta go.
Ten minutes.
What do we do?
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
You have the wrong feeling.
They could be.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Is Annie around?
Well, she's totally not here.
Hey, Laurie...
Are you coming over tonight?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
Promise?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
I'm scared!
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
There's nothing else I can do.
Oh, good...
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
I love that.  That's my type.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Mm-hm.
I can't resist.
It's really sad.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Like, uh...?
Hi.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
How about you?
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Elliot!  Don't!
Elliot!
I was looking for you.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
I thought you weren't coming.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
They're fantastic.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
You bet.
It's so late.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
No!
I didn't say that.
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
I am... I did slave all day.
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
Want some coffee or tea?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
...or films you must see or... 
I don't sell my work by the yard!
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Oh, yes, you have!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Go right over there.
What?  You're kidding!
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Don't you think she does?
He's married...
Sometimes she's terrific...
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
At least I'm open to new concepts!
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Good.  How are you?
You look wonderful.
It was a terrible evening.
No, you can tell me.
No, I am.  I am.
You're kidding me.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
It's all right.
Mickey?
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
A reward...
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
...<u>please</u>...
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
We could skip the Gavotte.
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
C'mon, pal.
You want to get married...?
That's right.
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
I like Popcorn...
You give me whatever I want...?
Now, why in the world would he do that?
What reaction?
Yes, I did.
...unmarked hundreds....
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
Look at this:
What is that supposed to mean...?
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
What'd you say, hon...?
Give it up, Evelda.
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
You look lovely.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
Thank you, Cordell.
...might I make a suggestion...?
What's that, Baby?
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What was it.  What was it, honey?
...what?
...what...?
"Because we don't have any money."
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
I know where he is.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
My encounter.
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
No, they're not from Wendy.
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
...sorry...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Hey.
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
What else don't you believe in?
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
God, you're beautiful.
I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?
Sorry Veronica.
Don't say that.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
Gee, thanks.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
I was talking with someone!
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
Where did you get these?
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
Shit.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
And your worst enemy.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
Did to.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
We're breaking up. I am out!
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
This knife is filthy.
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
Let's kick his ass.
Answer him dick!
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
He's the manager!
I'm educating myself!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
I'm so happy to see you!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
That's coming along well!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
looks startled at the outburst.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
I shall call him Diello.
John has fallen in love with me!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Let's go overseas . . .
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Bye, Dad.
Are you a dream too?
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Of course, yes.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
I understand... I won't-
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Bret... what the fuck...?
What did you just say?
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
That was cold...
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
What's under that sheet...?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
Bernie, how'sa kid?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
I...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
I... I know that, John...
You were... very... inspiring.
What's the matter?
What is it?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
That too.
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Ticket!  What's going on?
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
Reporters don't have hormones?
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Safety?
Give it here, Bernard.
Was that your dad?
And the rent is okay?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Oh, great.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Where'd he go?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
Did you hear that?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Do you remember who gave us this?
How long does it have to be a new house?
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
What?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Even better.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Lieutenant?
What do you think?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
Tough.
He had to come from somewhere.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
What?
Detective Bedsoe.
You sure?
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
You?
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
France.
To ask her to dance.
What do you think?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Different places.
Do you love me, Conner?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Corpses?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Then who's Russell Nash?
Yes.
Good evening.
I'm just trying to place you.
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
Is there anything else you need?
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
You get anything on Smith?
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
I guess not.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
That woman's gonna call the cops.
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
It's over.  We have to give up.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
I'll give you these people.
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
He needs a doctor.
The cops are comin'!
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
What if it goes south?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
What do you want?
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I need to work out some stuff.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
What?
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
That's not enough.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
She didn't answer.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
What's my name?
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
He has lots of disks.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Are the disks still in your room?
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Ten thousand francs for each one.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Paul, you know who this is?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Excuse me, Colonel.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
Where are my supplies?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
We must go to the Diplomat.
Your police are at the gate?
I committed no war crimes.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Here, have a sandwich.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
Thomas wants advice?
No.
You could have asked for a favor.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
They do not have your connections.
The president has been murdered.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
What!
Go to the roof now.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
I have a confession. When we met...
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
It was substantial.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Oh, my babies.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
What do we do with all these people?
What are you doing?
Where has all our beer gone?
How much beer?
All. What do you mean all?
Paul, are you there?
There are soldiers.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
It's complicated. But don't worry --
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
More the merrier.
Don't think it'll be a problem.
Excuse me?
Where is it??
I'm sorry --
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
'Less the place really is haunted.
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Uhhhh...
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
This is nuts.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
What? Deep down inside?
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
What are you looking for?
This is the best we're gonna do.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
What --
You okay?
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
Jesus!
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
You think this is fucking funny??
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
First time for everything.
Please! Something! Oh-God!
House 2, Guests 0.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
What is it??
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
-- the window and door grates --
I was upstairs!
I'll take my chances.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
Ghosts killed your father?
For the love of God....please...?
Damn it.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Did you find her?!
Are you all right?
It will heal.
Good-bye.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
It's going to hurt us!
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
Help me!  Please!!!
What's he doing daddy?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
What's the matter?
What will Aubrey think?
To our family.
No.
What is it?
But do you agree with me?
Who?
Oh come on!
A friend?
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
Maura.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
Your daughter's been taken.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
You must be the new tenants.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
We'll never know for sure.
This isn't happening...
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Not on station time.
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Uh-huh?
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
What?
I'll boil some water.
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
But I don't know what's going on.
Terri?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
Uh-huh.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Yes. 53
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Really?
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Cameras?
You got about five minutes and change.
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
Oh, you read that.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Where did you get this?
I wanna know...
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Cat got his tongue?
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
...Hello?
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
Ol' satchel-butt...
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
Confused?
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...You do?
...The people look like ants.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Your i --
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Just got hired today!
I got big ideas, though!
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Awwww, buddy --
...It is?
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
...This'll only take a moment.
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
But --
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
...Enter the dame.
Hello, Niagara.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
At the Houmfort.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
I'd love to.
Mrs. Rand.
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
It is not beautiful.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Can't I take it for you?
Why was the maid crying?
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
I suppose so.  Yes.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
You wanted to warn me...
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
Benjie!
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
I'm, uh, going to bed.
I... I think I am...
Dinner in ten minutes.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
Don't start.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
I'll drive you --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
About?
Huh?
A prior engagement overcame me.
Good-night dad.
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
It's what?
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
Who?
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Where you going?
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
What do you mean?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Where you going?
Did you tell Sandy?
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Wow!
When worlds collide.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Her name's Libbets.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Yeah.
Good.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Duggar called him?
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
Thanks.
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
What are you doing here?
Forget your pager?
No.
Where you signed this?
Eight years.
What do you want to talk about?
He's just rattling your cage.
No way.
What if someone finds out?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
You heard me that time.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
I told you I don't remember.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Hey...
No...
I don't know.
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
No game.
No.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Monstrous.
Who made us what we are?
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
I have not spoken to him...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
And yet you knew what I would o.
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
You... fed on me?
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
How do I look?
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
Or her, or her - or any of them?
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
What do you want from me?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Let's call that a start.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Take him.
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
Have you ever been caught?
We belong in hell.
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
No... You come back to me Louis...
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
And they frighten you?
You followed me here, didn't you?
You can't look at them...
Did he die in the fire?
Lestat escaped the fire!
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
I'm the King of the World.
You get any sleep at all?
Cancer in a box.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Ray, I can't...
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
Never do that again.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Oooh, the mainland --
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
I'll come with you.
Rio de Janeiro!
Well, there's some flaws in her...
What's the matter, boy trouble?
He leave you?
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Where is Miss Wollsten?
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
You are fortunate in your father.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
I felt he did not like me.
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic!
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in —- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me —— a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
I know all you are going to say —-I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -—there is something about her ——the way she moves —— the way she turns her head.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Well, tell, him.
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
I . . .
She's . . .
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Hey, who's that?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Splendid! Is he sick?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Is this the place?
Hi, Daddy.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
Uh-huh.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
Anything I can do back here?
Is it a charge, sir?
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Oh, it's wonderful.
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Well, no younger than I was.
George.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Hey, George . . .
Some other time, George.
Well, what do you know –– wife.
Why didn't you call me?
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
All of it?
Those Rockefellers!
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Yes, sir.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Made up your mind yet?
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Well, hello.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
After that, who cares?
Oh, Mary . . .
Have fun.
Hi.
Where's your coat and hat?
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Oh, George, George, George.
Oh, George, George!
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
How about that one there?
Wheee!  Faster!
It's okay, it's okay....
Get on the rocks!
Yeah, it's her job.
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Loser sails home alone.
I thought you said she was going with us?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
What is it?  What's there?
How long ago?
I can't let you take her out.
You're too close.  Back off.
Do I have to?
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Wait a minute....
It came up during the meeting.
The what?
The whale's mouth?
Okay, so that's it.
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Need a ride?
Eat Cheerios.
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Nothing.
No.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
What're you doing?
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Yeah?  Then what?
When?
Is that me?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
It killed her.  It ate her.
Terry!  You okay?
Get a dance yet?
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Be careful....
About damn time.
What is it?
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
Heading back?
Who wouldn't.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
You're going out.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
We're ready for you.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
Sure am.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
My imagination isn't that good.
And what else is bothering you?
Not enough loving.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
What's wrong?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Where are you going?
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Michael...
You're going down there again?
Here.
Change your mind?
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
You want me to stay?
Finally.
They said you'd be here.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Yes.  It's faster.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Michael, take deep breaths.
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
How is he?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
That's right.
Me.
I am.  You're not.
Are you okay?
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
I want that shark alive.
You look like an orange worm.
How's sleeping beauty?
Not at all.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
He's big as a bloody bus!
A piece of pie on Sunday.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
Musclehead?
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
So, you just get here?
How long you staying?
I'm a water-skier.
Well, I needed a cold shower.
You were great out there!
Herpes?
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
Isn't this fun!
Let's go, let's go!
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Yes, there is goes.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
The world's southern most reaches.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
What kind of trouble?
Took it this morning.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Come on, let's go.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
Come on, sweetheart....
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
No fair, I'm not armed.
Where have you been...?
Where is she?
Where's my mother?
Michael!  This thing working?
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
I like Grandma's cooking....
Sit down, Ma....
All you all right?
You could teach...You could....
You're having a good time....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
It's just like driving a car....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
They had them on the big one....
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Keep it steady....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
Still tagging conch?
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
How many...?
I know how to tag a damn conch....
They won't fight with me....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
Okay...we got it together....
How long?
What's so funny about that?
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
What about Carla's gig?
How come only me?
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
Stop that!
You told me what?
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
How about any guys on your staff?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
Yeah, he can go ...
Who is who?
Not for me ..
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
What do you mean?
Why?
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Did he shut you down?
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Ease off, John ..
What about Citrine?
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Now?
Listen, you don't havta come?
Where's your watch?
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Did he get you the job?
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
Can I see your hands?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
What are you reading?
Are you married?
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
You know? How do you know?
Why?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
Who sought the warrant?
Is that Margie?
So tonight she confesses?
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Well, no you didn't --
I have to finish my job --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Didn't hear it.
He's asleep, right?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
It's all going to work.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Too bad.
Truth?
Well.
Don't worry about it, boss.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
What --
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
It's my fault.
I don't know --
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
What about medical?
He's coming over.
Forgot your keys --
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
I got it.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
Rod --
What are you doing with me, Rod?
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
What's wrong.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Not everyone has what you have.
I have to ask.
And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
Oh, tell the story.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
You gonna get that --
Cronin's okay for lunch?
Jerry --
Let's go the zoo.
Oh, my God.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
He says it's a bad idea!
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
What?
What did you say?
Young adult.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
I don't remember
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
Where's Dad?
They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
We could co-write a paper.
We need to keep moving.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Good luck with the fund raising.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
What did you think?
We need to head for the coast.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
That's hard to believe.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
How do you mean?
What?
Are you looking for a problem?
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
Hi, Dad.
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
How could you possibly?
What are you guys gonna do?
How close do you have to be?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What?
Where's the power and radio setup?
We took to the rock.
It's... behind... us.
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
Their what?
What?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
No way.
?!
Something's wrong.
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Can you set up?
Ian.  It's guano.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Where's Kelly?
Ask her.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
But would we get the phones back?
You shouldn't use my name.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
They are?  I'll be damned.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
And what are those?
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
- - like birds - -
Alan?!
Hola, Juanito
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
These look kind of familiar.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
Dad - - Dad - -
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
It's safe?
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
I like cows.
What's that?
Let's go!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Your silence intrigues me.
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
Well?
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
I don't know...
Two.
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
What happened?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Doesnit sleep?
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
How do we prove it?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Fascinating.
Add it to the list.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Ten minutes...
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
-- Merely in the interests of order.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
-- You appreciate my writing.
Will you do me a favor then?
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
What's funny?
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
They're not obliged to tell.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Probably not.
I'll bear that in mind.
What's the matter with you?
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
It's gone out so quickly?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
I could always apply there.
Ludwig.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
Holy God! The mummy walks!
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
I can't imagine you crying.
Give it back!
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
What was it, Jack?
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Mm.
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Do you always have to repeat?
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
Oh no.
-- We can talk --
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
What about?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
You remind me of my uncle.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Well do you think it was him?
He never told me.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
Is that all you have to say?
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
Then, close the case.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
That who?
I can't follow you.
John, how are you?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Not unusual.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Well?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Where is the child?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
What do you like best about her?
What do you like best about your daddy?
On earth.
What if she forgets?
You're late.
Okay...Same as usual...
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Is mom ever coming back?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Objection.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Objection!
So do I.
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
How long was that?
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
And?
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
How should I know?
So...what's so terrible about that?
And?
Three months.  How can you tell?
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
I lost him?  I lost him?
Oh, no..
Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Things? What kind of things?
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
You ever think about getting married again?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
She ever ask about me?
Thelma, if I die--
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
Huh.. .Hello?
All quiet?
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
I worry about them.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
I do, now.
Where will you keep them?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Did you receive the letter?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
Yes.
This many?
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Where is Alsace?
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
Tell me.
What can I do? I am only a boy.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
America, we shall see.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
Did you ever doubt it?
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
Hmm.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
You killed him.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
Why are we landing?
I might get a shot.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
Around here.  Yeah.
We are here on official business.
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
The more he thrashes, the better.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Where is he?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
With crocodiles... everything's even.
And how would we neutralize him?
You're gonna be okay.
Kelly Scott.
I'm not making it up.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
I didn't say it like that.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
We might as well pack.
Get him onto shore.
If I'm ever in New York...
No.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
What's that?
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
He just came up screaming.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
Hank?
They're coming right in.
That's not what you came to say.
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
This is what we do?
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
You and Kevin.
Myra.
No. He won't come after me.
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
What girl?
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Why?
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
No, I came because we need -
Five... so far.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
And the questionnaire...?
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
No. Tell me why.
Horses - and sheep...
I - ran away...
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
What...?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
He did?
The Ottawa are gone.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Much further?
Mr Poe?
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
That is the truth!
Where do we go from here?
What did you say?
Will you men help us stop the French?
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
What happened to you?
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Yes.
Yes.
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
My colors?
Qui vive?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Be careful with it.
We're getting out of here just in time.
It's got Hazy!
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Your suit, Becky!
That was a loud one wasn't it?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
It hit me!  Where are they?!
I'm going inside.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Thank you, Martin.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Made your million, yet?
If he had his blinkers on--
What the?...
Listen to it for Christsake.
So that's all you do?...
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
How is he?
It needs blood?
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
Yes?
What's that?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
There are no others.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
Have you counted the money?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
We gotta get those guns.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
And look what happened to that.
Well, what's going on?
What do you mean?
Well, what did he say?
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
Tom?
I will.
I think I would rather just turn them over.
I'll see ya.
It's pay day, ain't it?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
What's left over?'
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
That makes it okay?
That isn't true.
And what did she do?
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Who's "they"?
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Private Johnson!
Sam the Man.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
You got a cause of death?
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
I'm not picking it up.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Same weight I always was.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
You've been in this house for a while?
I never met her.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
Well--
Didn't have a father?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Tanks, huh?
How's your room shaping up?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
What?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Cliff--
Mikey--
You spoil 'em, Cliff.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
This is an official visit, then--
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Reputation?
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Is very beautiful, your car.
You have somebody else out there?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
Your mother was a saint.
Historic occasion, isn't it?
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
Never heard from him again?
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
Thank you.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
She finally got in--
Time marches on.
Three months.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
I see she built a place up here by the river.
Your boy, there--
So why did you come back here, Sam?
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
Yeah?
We start from scratch--
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
I didn't want to be going around your back.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
I know you?
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
You going to tell her?
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Nix.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
Take a look at this.
How'd you spell that again?
D'Amour.
Who did this?
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Sorry.  You asked.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Are they treating you okay?
So why did you marry him?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
Oh Christ.
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
What then?
Yes.
What was that?
... oh... God...
...yes?
Valentin?
Bad show last night?
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Are you finished with me?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Shit.
Whose is the car?
Who is she?
I like to know why things happen.
Are you satisfied now?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
D'Amour --
Him too.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
My God.
Hold on.
The Puritan?
Harry D'Amour.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
How the fuck do you do that?
You think I'm an asshole.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
That's where we're all going.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
Can you do it?
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
You don't think I've got it to give?
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Yeah, they told me.
What about you? Why are you here?
How long have you been married?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
I don't want to go home.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Really?
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
Yeah? But look at you.
No one ever tells you that...
You think so?
When are you leaving?
I'm going to miss you.
Lydia?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Hello?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
It's ok.
What?
I guess she's busy.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Hello?
Hair stuff?
See you later.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
I miss you.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
You never said anything to me...
Peter, where are you?
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I found them in your file box.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
Yes.
Seemed...on edge.
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
I can take care of myself.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
He spoke to you?
You fucking bastard.
Why are you doing this to me?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
Father, please don't die.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
So...what did you think of the tape.
What do you mean?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
Why did he try to kill me?
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
I don't understand what's going on.
What are you looking for exactly?
Nothing yet.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
There's nothing else here.
Plenty of time.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
He was trying to tell me something.
Hello?
It's useless...look at him.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
Good of you to stop by.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Parents died?
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
nothing.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
What?
Hi.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
What?
My mouth is kinda dry.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
You ever been in love?
They ever love you back?
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
Thanks, Sidra.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
I know.
Well, what do you know.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
So?
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
See you made it.
You don't look half-bad.
Hey.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Why?
When'd you get this?
That was so weak.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
I...can't.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Who's nobody?
Can we talk?
You're what?
So...I guess I'll see you around.
What are the doctors saying?
Funny.  I never did.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Actually, I don't...
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Like what?
So why'd you give up ball?
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
What's going on?
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
Hey, girl.
No.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
With who?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
What is this?
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
How was your game?
Still the man.
Later when?
You scared me.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
Why?
Still is, so let yourself out.
And some things should never fucking happen!
I ain't a damn liar.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
What do you want?
Look, I'm busy.
No need for braces, Donnie.
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
What do you want? Why are you here?
What the fuck do you want?
I don't wanna talk to you.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Please put your clothes on, please --
Honey.
Yeah, but I don't know --
No.
You take cream or sugar?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
Please, yes.
Eight o'clock?
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
Well.
It's ok.
Say what you want and you'll see --
No, what's wrong?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
What?
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
How much you pay me for my help?
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Presence - with a double ass meaning gifts I bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause I throw what I know with a Resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf Jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
Did you listen to me?
Doc it's Janet.
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
What?  What does that mean?
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
That's right.
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
Picky, picky.
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
I'm sick.
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
...please...
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
I've been a good worker --
Give me your keys, Don.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
...cocksucker....
Do me a personal favor --
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
All it takes is one second?
I'm gonna start rolling --
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I would just want to clear some things up:
Are you asking me that?
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Do you have your masters?
Kind of.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
He's in here.
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
Is he in pain?
Uh. huh.
He's in here --?
It's interesting.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
You're just come in --
I AM CALM.
What does it look like?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
What were you saying, Stanley?
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
No.  No.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
Who?
That's it.
Two years...three years...
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I don't.
I love you so much.
Jimmy, did you touch her?
But you can't say....
Yes you do.
She's asleep.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
They look pretty smart, I think.
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
Linda --
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
Partridge?
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
C'mon, man.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Hi.
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
...what...?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
Mother -- ?
What is it, mother?
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
We must stop him!
He seeks redemption.
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
Pull them back!
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
And why are you so glum?
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
But why?
We go someplace dangerous.
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
What do we do now?
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Thanks, but not for me.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Raoul is everything to me.
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
Recent hours have been a shock.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
Are you hungry?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
Betrothed?  I think not.
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
I was told this impostor was dead!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Where is Michelle?
Phillippe!
Did they kill him?
Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
What can I do for you?
What do you think?
What the hell happened?
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
So where are you from?
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Jesus, man...
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Donut?
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Are you going to be alright?
Long gone, huh?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
What about him?
I wouldn't presume to try.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
You look all right now.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
Who is it?
Tell me now.
You got the message Lecktor called...
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
He's a very shy boy...
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
Ride with me.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
I'll see you later. All right?
Who is it?
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you see?
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Yes?
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
Can you read it to me?
In a holding cell.
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
I don't understand.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
He's misunderstood.
He's very strong physically.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
'Intimate? !"
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
Me, too. And very erotic...
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
To do what?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Do you remember what you said?
Maybe we should give it some time...
Yes. Who are you?
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
You went in the apartment?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
What disadvantage?
I don't have one right now.
May I keep the file?
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
People love... comedians.
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
I'm sorry, George...
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
So how can I help you...?
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
My hair is coming out.
Five.
Ten.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Hi...
Popcorn?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
"Philosophically"?
It's probably just a strained muscle.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
Is he in his room?
Why is he saying these things?!
Bob.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
You got the money?
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Don't be ridiculous.
Did you hear that?
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
Why you're here?
Five.  Since I've been here.
Dead.  All dead.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
All right --
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
How?!
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
... am I dead?
What are you doing?
Why do my eyes hurt?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
Set down in there.
The beginning?
How does she know?
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
My name is Trinity.
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
What the hell is this?!
From what?
What is this thing?
What are you doing?
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
It's a city?
Where is it?
What are they doing to him?
Why?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Know where he is?
What are your plans?
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
No, all we got is $40.
No.
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Look at her.
So?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Next time, bet with your own kind.
Nah.
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
Let's get out of here.
Shut up!
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Don't you move!!!
I think we should see your uncle.
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
Oh great...hey - Winstons?
OK, ok...
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
You getting out too?
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
You're really crazy.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
Hey, where you been?
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
Take your time.  I don't care.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
Must have been all the liquor in him.
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
Dinner?  Again?
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Have you got a minute?
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Oh, the goddam party --
I wasn't going to say --
Paillarde of veal.
Yeah, but --
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
What are you eating.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
...See you tomorrow night.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Well... goodnight.
We have an arrangement now.
I didn't say.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
In my sleep.
'Yes'.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Have we met?
No --
Why?
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
Whose?
You're overthinking it --
He was interested.
But I didn't mean to do it!
Doctor lady make it irey.
Can't, sistah.
Not time yet.
Don' be facety, woman.
I am.
She knows how she feel.
Don' need you okayin'.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
The Board is waiting.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
I've got plenty of friends.
Yes?
And I'll be a visitor.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Yes...
Almost.
I'm sorry about --
'Love will find out the way'?
Did I say that?
The 'coffee shop' --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
Susan --
No --
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
Joe --?
I'm not everybody.
I want to live.
Yes.
Excellent.  What is it?
Truly - uh - splendid.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Bill --
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
'Spooning'?
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
I'm sorry, Bill --
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
Okay.
He is --
You want me to be your guide --?
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
Are you giving me orders?
Where are you?  Are you there?
Please.  Talk to me --
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
About what?
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Good morning, Dad.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Thank God.
Daddy, what's the matter?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
That was wonderful.
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
Then what is it?
Where is he?
This is crazy --
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
But what?
Daddy --
I love you, Daddy --
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
Why?
Should I wear it?
Burt.
You don't know?
Amnesia?
My wife.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
Where'd you get it?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
Jimmy?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
You think you can bargain with me?!
You don't remember me.
Is that what your little note says?
You know him?
Have I told you what this man did?				*
Sleep okay?
How do I know he did that to you?
It's not easy to be calm when -
What do the police think?
Who?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
What does he want?
Yes.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
Dying.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Why?
I don't think so.
So what are you gonna do now?
Unfinished business.
What do you mean "bad news"?
She has no idea who I am.
How'd you know I was in here?
Why?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
Your name's Teddy.
I should kill you.							 *
It is now.
What cop?
* Thank you.							    *
We know these people...!
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
How many?
My end?
Where's that?
Were you born in Havana?
Mojitas...?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Like...?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
If they attack you...
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
What...?
You afraid of violence?
Red light, green light, José?
Yeah.
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
What's our deal?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
So?
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
Hey, fuck him.
What's your take?
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
Never heard of him.
Out of...?
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
Yeah...?
Oh, good...
You okay?
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
What...?
The Statue of Liberty.
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
You ain't coming to work?
Must be some mess back there.
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
I can tell, can't you?
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
Okay. Never argue with a man.
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
Oh hell, forget it.
What's in your socks?
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
You don't seem like no fag...
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
These guys're good drivers.
I read it.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Sounds like they knew you.
What d'you want?
Listen, I gotta have money.
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
Ready for hard work, son?
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
Looks like a cheap hotel.
Two kilos.
Years?
Tunnel?
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
You got that, shit face? Asina...
To what?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Where are the minefields?
Yes...?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Yes.  I think so.
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
...are you with the Consulate?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
What's your father do?
How's it feel?
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
What they give you?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
Hello, Billy.
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
We go back.
What?
What?
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
You're ayip!
Jeremy...
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
And a right.
Look, I showed you my badge...
Did you see the size of that thing?!
Its muscles are locked.
A mistake.
What are you doing down here?
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
Which way?
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Thought it was my week for that.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
No, Jesus, no.
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
What's this?
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
What's it about?
The profanity bothers you?
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Then who did?
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
See, isn't this nice?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
You've been out of your room.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
Yes, Paul.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
Not much luggage.
On what.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
See anything you like?
You picked another winner!
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
Feel like pleading for your life?
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
Where?
What was the top bid?
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
Well do you disagree with that?
What are you doing here?
Hola..
What's you name?
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
There's nearly 2 million in London.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
And that's the only reason?
Before you are.
Just like old times?
Have you met them?
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
- you who don't have a conscience.
No.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
Roger that.
Luther, say again.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
What kind of show.
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
What are you going to do?
I didn't say that.
What happened?
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Two cars.  Where are you?
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Claire.
Go ahead.
Are you damaged?
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Yes.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What are we downloading?
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Why, may I ask?
Why should I?
Mm - Hmmm...
Very good.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
How will you make sure Job will be there?
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Zero body count.
Merci.
Give me the God damn gum.
Would you remove your hat please?
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
Iíve got a shadow.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
You got it.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Why don't you take a look?
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
The Shawfish?
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
Have I been a good wife?
Okay.
Rose, pass the wine.
Hi.  Hi.
I don't know what you mean.
You're not sleepy?
You look tired.
Johnny Cammareri.
In a month.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Oh, Cosmo!
You haven't once said you like my dress.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Why didn't he call himself?
Have you come from my brother?
Fast.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Yes.
Son of a bitch!
I've got you.
What about Johnny?
What?
I'm marrying your brother!
You don't get along with anybody!
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
But that's cause he don't know!
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Thank you!
They get some turnout for this stuff.
That was just so... awful!
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
I'm here!
I'm really afraid.
I'm freezing to death.
You've gotta get outta here.
I got things to do.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
I have no secrets from my family.
No.
How's the mother?
What! How do you know?
WHAT!! She was dying!
Talk to him.
So.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Have you come to make peace with me?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Go ahead.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
I guess you can't invite me in?
I'm freezing
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Cosmo.
You got me.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
How do you know she is a witch?
Burn her anyway.
You're using coconuts!
Where did you get the coconuts?
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Well, how did you become king, then?
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
I move for no man.
Come Here.
Hello.
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
What is your name?
Now what happens?
Nu!
Ni, ni, ni!
What with?
What?
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
You know my name?
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
The nose?
What is your name?
That's easy!
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
Do you want to come and have a drink?
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
Herbert.
But, Father.
Who are you?
Leaving the room ... yes.
Right.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
... I Bet you're gay.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
How much?
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
It's the Queen's decision.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Gesture?
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
By whose authority?
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
No.
That can wait till the weekend.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
Do you hunt?
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
So...?
I promised to protect her from people like you.
Mr Brown.
You are here safely.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
We took a nip of whiskey.
I was told you were in a fight.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
What can we do?
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
Then they may read about me.
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
This is my good John Brown.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
What did he want?
We're going to lose.
A fine choice, sir.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Well?
Has he been hurt?
How long has he been this sick?
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Read it.
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
How the hell did you do that?
Talk to me.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
So where is he?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Something's happened to them.
Change the channel!
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
The Police, then...
You mean we learn the rules...
You got the schematics?
Alex...
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
You don't get it, do you?
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
The clock's already ticking.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
Shit...
Our time's up.
What the fuck is that?!
We can't reach that!
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
Mom?  You're alive...
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
So what do you think?
But I'm not broke.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
It will work out.
Yes...what is it?
So, what did they say?
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
No, I don't.
It's unbelievable!
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
A car ... a car accident.
No, no, I'm fine.
Betty.
I think I've been hurt.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
What's wrong?
What do you mean? You're Rita.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Those men in front, in the car.
No... but...
I don't think...
Rita... I know what you're doing.
No, we don't.
Yeah, what for?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
The one of 'em still alive?
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
No.  I haven't seen any.
Is that it ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
So what do we do ?
What are you doing ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
I... I .....
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
Yeah a real shame.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
It's fine thanks.
You okay ?
Don't eat at the console.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
What is Bruce doing ?
What was that ?
We can't afford too many surprises.
Will he make it out ?
What's next ?
Look ! Look !
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
What the ... ?
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Really ? On a date ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
He was right behind me !
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Umm, where do you want this?
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
I don't think you're very polite.
THANK YOU.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
You want me to move?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.

Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Hi honey.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
We have a baby?
Never heard of him. 
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Maybe he's wet?
Thanks.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Do you have any pictures if her?
She's beautiful.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
What are you staring at?
Is it okay if I drink this?
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
What can I do for you?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Hi there...can I help you?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
Care for a smoke?
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Boyfriend?
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Come and get it.
Just come and get it...right here!
Woah, watch it!
Where are you going???
What's he smoking?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
It's not his fault!
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
But...are you engaged or something?
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
He was caressing.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
I think this place is just fine.
Bye Aunt Rose.
Excuse me?
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Good morning.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Why not now?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
It would be fantastic.
Shelly?
Did it hurt a lot?
Beidermeyer?
You're such a baby.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
The boss is watching us...
You are perfectly healthy.
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
You don't like it?
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
Well the other night at dinner...
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Harry, I really think she.....
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
No, why?
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Ahem.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
The money?
I like the freak show.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Did I kill my mother?
What was my mama like?
Really?
Why?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Sure.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
What do you get for that?
Please.
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Maybe black means you're happy?
Are you going out somewhere?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
No.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Naah, I don't wanna.
Hey look at this!
You have no personality.
What do you think it's like?
Sorry.
Pacifist!
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Run faster they're after us!!
Jump in the water!!
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Just do it.
Seeya tomorrow.
What?
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
I've lost interest.
Blood oath.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
Two words.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
What else did he tell you...
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
Jesus, we're trapped!
He'll see right through it.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
I saw the show.
Ex-cuse me?
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, you're a little early...
Well, sure.
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Waiter! Check, please!
Should I whistle down a cab?
Big weddings are so strange.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
I asked you...
Does that make it right...
Uh.  I saw that moving...
Why would she come here...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
No.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
What did you say your name was?
You going today?
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
What do you really want?
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
How is she?
It's on National television, Barnett.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
You want anything?  A drink?
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
What's he running for?
National television?
How much?
Where'd he ever see us?
Howdy.
Hey!
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
You want me to wait?
What?
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
Have you seen a woman about so high?
Wrecks.
We don't mess with accessories.
Parts.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Well...How have you been?
Oh.
When did you think it would happen?
Thirty?
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
What National TV...?
Sorry I'm late.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Hi.
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
Oh --
He is to a lot of people.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
You want a ride into town?
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
What did you think then?
Naw, she don't mind.
Mickey!
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
How is it?
You ready, Donut?
What I'd like to do---
Not to anybody. She sings.
Was what worth it?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Describe Mallory.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Says the United States of America.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
The entire wing?
You can't be serious?
Roger, no.
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Rollin'...and speed!
But how can you say that?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
I see.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Three.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Want me to come?
Who's going to buy me a beer?
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
I know.
What d'you want?
She done moved to Detroit.
People seen him 'round.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
His profession?
Any other family?
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
That's two bucks, Joe.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Oh yeah?
My father's the preacher.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
That's why you come back, huh?
Not here, Duff.
What d'you mean?
No, on the porch.
What's wrong?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Everything you cook is good.
Hmmm - good coffee.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
Don't, Duff.
About ten dollars.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
They all got families to support.
No.
How you doin', boy?
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
How often does he get like that?
How often is that?
Come on, Pop.
They'll run you out.
Don't be too hard on him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
Come on, Will.
Let's stay here, Will.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
Omar--
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
How long's it been?
Let me get you another glass of wine.
Can you get us into Straylight?
What the hell is that?
What you lookin' for, mon?
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
What are you talking about?
What's this?
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Yeah, well it's working.
You've got your orders.
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
What?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Yo.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
Want to fucking answer them?
I know who you are.
What is it?
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
Maybe something's onto him.
I gotta know... did it work>
How soon is soon enough?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
...Feels like you.
I'll get the car.
Case... Are you alright?
I know.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
Who?
Like what?
Get up.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
No Roger from op/ed?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
You're Pam?
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
You don't think I can do it.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
George! What are you doing here?
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Uhh, no.
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Hey there.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
You having fun?
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
It's just for a couple of months.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
You're twenty-three years old!
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Yoooooow.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Our penguin, right?
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
That is so sad --
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Into our group.
Aloha! Welcome!
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Taste it.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
You got your room straightened out yet?
Jesse, help!
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
You okay?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
Are you okay.
What's all this.
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
What is this place?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
What is it - What's wrong?
What is it?
It's gone now.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
'Morning.
Jess?
So, school going alright?
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Hi, guys.
Yor dad picking the music again?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Girl, what are you doing?
Horseshit.
I know who's trying to kill you.
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
Freddy?
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
I don't know...
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Crossed over?
Must have opened while I was away at school.
Stop blaming yourself.
We can try again.
I've heard crazier things this week.
Who is he?
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
What was that?
Science...I suppose.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Lovely to meet you.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
God, that's an enormous arse.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Sorry about that...
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Here we go.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Okay.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
So who left who?
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
Why?
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Eleven.
Yup.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
You like Chagall?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Oh please sod off.
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
Hi.
Sorry about that.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
He's bringing a girl?
Where are you going?
Yes.
Bernie.
Hello, Bernie.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Da Vinci?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
What do you think?  Good move?
Martin -- your customer.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Max.  This is Anna.
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Oh my God...  Hello.
Yes.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Bad news.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Why?
Yes, Mister Harding?
M-m-m-ma'am?
Yes, Billy?
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
So do I!
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Whatcha boys playin'?
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Ahhh, Billy...
Say it again.
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
Ya know what, Fred?
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
Okay, sucker.
It doesn't help him.
I'm busting outta this place.
What's your plan, Mack?
Don't you have any clubs?
Gimme a cigarette!
Who told you that?
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Right!
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
My turn.
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Oh, what's that?
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
I don't, Doc...
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
You bet, Doc!
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Yeah!
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
A dime.
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Oh yeah...
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
You know, I never got your name.
Who is he?
Hi.
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Hit me!
Yeah!
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
There they are!
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
What?
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
To the foot doctor.
Why are you asking me this?
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Mickey Spillane.
Do you want me to do it?
Nice dress.
What?...
So were you.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Been here long?
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Any night.
Faith, this is my mother.
I don't believe in statistics.
How about the other one?  His friend.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
But what?
Kate, is something the matter?
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
It's still the new year...
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
So?
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Faith--
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Who said I was going?
No.  No, you go ahead.
Peter found him?
Whatareyoudoing?!
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
So...
What about Larry?
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
Oh.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
It's siesta.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Yeah--
And you didn't tell her?
Where is she?
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
Right now?
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
Well, where are they?
It'll do.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
But my own kid bro—
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
They're waiting for him to walk in.
They play pretty rough.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
Wham... .
No thanks... .
And if you don't?
You're not sore at me?
What are you crying for?
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
I've been sittin' in the church.
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
Jimmy...
Where you goin'?
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
I want to see you, Terry.
This is my business.
You can!
Who asked him here?
What do you think?
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Hey, Skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
I— I was just on my way up, Johnny.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Something's making that music.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
You're talking nonsense.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
When!?
The moon is almost gone!
I understand, Master
There are others.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Lie face down on the floor.
Yes.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
I don't know where he is.
Where in the hell are we?
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Just that she got away.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
Jack?
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Let's go to Detroit.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
What?
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
Hello, Daniel.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
All right, but...
You get the key?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Quite a mess.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Nervous?
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
You don't seem all that scared.
Is that right?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
I mean, romantically.
How'd you get this number?
That's my dad.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Think I could have them back?
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Oh, God...
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
You like taking risks.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
You getting serious on me now?
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
Take your sunglasses off.
Weren't you expecting us?
Whose blood you got all over you?
I thought you guys were busted.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
I hear six.
Thanks for your help.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I were you, I'd get up and run.
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The flight?
Meaning?
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
You don't remember me, do you?
Do we have a gun in the car?
Take the next exit.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
And is Foley a part of this?
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
That was some shit, huh?
You're a fighter?
I can tell.
I'm looking for Maurice.
Got run over by a car.
It's beautiful.
Thanks, Dad.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
What are you thinking about?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
How do I look, mama?
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
What?
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Are you sure they're here?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
Nervous?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Good shooting, Danny!
Didn't you say test the limits?
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
We gotta face some facts here.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
They're all over us!
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
How's everything?
Sorry.
So beautiful!
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Don't get smart with me, son.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
Well sure, Colonel --
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
How often you fight like this?
Danny's not coming?
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
Rafe --
What?...
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
Leapin' Jesus!
Fook ya!
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Welcome to the singles scene.
We're going to take you home.
What happened?
But you love me don't you?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Where did you get that sweater?
Charlie, how are you?
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
What are you doing here?
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
What're you doing here?
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Just take a look at it. 
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Oh, Charlie.
I love you.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Yes, sir.
Terry, slow down.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
Coffee and a donut.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
Ssh. He's great.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Damn that Charlie I
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
Hi, Dad.
For me?
I closed my Christmas club.
Yes.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh, you're both so naive.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Who was that man?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Maddy's party.
Where have you been?
What are you doing?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Don't eat the red ones.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
You look pretty good for a corpse.
You're giving me the creeps.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty—fifty.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
What's the matter?
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
I think so.
What's his name?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
I know, Mom.
Jesus.
Do you really think so, Andy?
Thanks, Walter.
Thanks, you guys.
Don't apologize for me.
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
Drew!
What's wrong with you?
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
What's that mean?!
I'm ready...
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
New baby?
Congratulations.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Thanks for your time.
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
How did they find out?
PARRTYY!
What do you want?
We proceed, representing your estate.
I'll look over the Q and A.
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Are you a good lawyer?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Thanks for coming by.
Rach.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Hello?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
In what way?
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
A homosexual encounter.
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
Since when?
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Joe?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Not when I was in the Navy.
Going on... like...?
Let's continue.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
Probably okay to talk to me now.
You did this? To yourself?
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Why, what'd you hear?
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
What about her?
How many you see?
As fast as you can.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
They're already dead. Get on board.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
You barely know them.
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
There....
What, switch what?
S'matter?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
So now you know.
Didn't bite.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
He can pilot?
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
We aren't completely stupid.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
This does not help us, Johns.
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Fry?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
Owens!
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
Hasan?
The sled as a shield....
New Mecca....
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
Dr. Zaius --
The best. But we won't need them.
Do you have to work tonight?
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Well, maybe they're not.
Which direction?
Any particular reason?
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
What happened?
Gone.
Landon! Join the expedition.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
All right --
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
We got off at the wrong stop.
Gorilla hunters ...
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
ThatÕs a lie!
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Then there is another jungle?
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Listen-
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
He's moving his fingers!
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Yeah?
You lame Taylor?
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Taylor! Francis!
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
But what'd she actually do?
I'll go with you.
No, thanks...
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
What we got here a crusader?
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
No thanks?
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Okay. You win.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I think I'd like to dance.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Good evening, Miss.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
And do you amuse the guests?
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Cold?
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
Us?
Anything I can do about it?
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
Cold?
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
It buys things, just like any other kind.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
I think you mean that.
Yes, Miss.
Beer or ale, Miss?
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
Got it on you?
All right, let's see the buzzer.
What's this in favor of?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Mitchell was too drunk.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
A little something on account perhaps?
Passkey?
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
Got a moment, Inspector?
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
You in charge here?
Right.
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Was that about the right angle?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
He checks too.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
Get out of here!
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
To Ann.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
Terrific.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
It's terribly good.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
Can I give you a lift?
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
You don't trust me.
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
Might?
Jeremy phoned this morning
Bastard.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
What have you been up to?
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
Hello.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
What would you call it?
It was last year.
Ah, Susy, it...
Thanks for stepping in.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
Ever done this before?
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
I can't do this.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Three seconds... two... one...
Wild ride, huh?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
What?
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Got it.
Aw shit.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Nothing?
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Look at you.
Those are cold.
Well, I saw you and--
My name's Johnny Utah!
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Mean anything to you?
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
Thanks.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
What's got Billy so spooked?
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
You're looking well, Dutch.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
What in God's name...?
Where the hell is his body?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
It's... it's not like that.
Congratulations, sir.
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
You looking' for some company?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
No, you look like a hooker.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
What's your name?
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
What's your name, lover.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Good morning.
Where'd you go?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
It'd cost you.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Hello?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
What id we run into someone I know?
Real genuine guy.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Fuck off.
Do I look okay?
What's that?
Edward, I can't.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
I've never treated you like a whore.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Love this car!  Is it new?
I want to.
What!?
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
Why do you want to know?
Did I wake you?
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Yeah.
What kind of school?
You bullshittin' me?
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I got a dress.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
May I help you?
Are you looking for something in particular?
What is with you?
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
Every ship but the four you sent.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Who are you?
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
... as ... you ... wish...
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
I fear I'll never see you again.
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
Why should that make such a difference?
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
Faster!
Hello.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
I don't think more than ten.
The Man in Black?
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
You've been mostly dead all day.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
I brought you a special present.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Yes.
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Yellin.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
-- yes --
Sixty-five.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
We'll wait until you're ready.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
You are wonderful!
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
There's something I ought to tell you.
Kill me quickly.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Yes.
I accept.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Then make your choice.
-- get back, witch --
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Yeah, an hour.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Yes, what?
What did I do?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
You're going to jump on me.
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Maybe it's not true!
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Don't help me.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Vaaaat???
Not.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Do it!  Do it!
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
We make love?
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
You out to buy a motel?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
No! Of all...
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
Not at all!
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Yes.
I still feel...
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
You want me to stay here?
Where... can I stay?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
Yes.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
What?
What is it?
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
It's regular. Okay?
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
I can come down next week.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
You're very... kind.
Why do you ask that?
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Phoenix?
Alright, Miss... 
In quite a hurry.
Is there?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
What's down there?
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
Yes, why?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
But what about lunch?
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Do you know George Winton?
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
That happens to be the truth.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
What is it? What happened?
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
But I have some friends waiting.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
I'd know him anywhere.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
What was her name?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
Dysfunctional --
I've been dreaming about this.
In what sense were they bad?
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
'Course it does.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Buddy, you're just a child.
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
What do you think, Brother?
The new girl is here.
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
Yeah.
There goes Mother.
He had his hand on her titty.
What's happening?
How could that be, son?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Is her husband sick or something?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Of course.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Quarter of twelve.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Now you listen to me, Rose --
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Took your time gettin' here.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
Yes, go on.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Yes, Ma'am.
Never again, never again...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
I was going to tell him.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
What'd I say?
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
You shouldn't litter.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
Jiminy Christmas.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
The booze.
Dean Martin.
Gimmie a butt.
It doesn't say that.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
I can't believe we're stealing.
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
He tried to kill us.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
Arriving tonight
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
What... ?  Not you too?
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Let's get this thing done.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Get his attention.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
Han!
You got her warmed?
I don't know.  Fly casual.
I...
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
We're coming!
All wings report in.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Then you know why I have to face him.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Yes or no will do.
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
He might be.  I don't know.
Janet!
Uh huh.
What was that bang?
I'm coming with you.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
"Sweet Transvestite"
On the day I went away.
Was all I had to say
Oh, no no, no no.
Creature of the night.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
What's funny?
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
Would ya like a glass of water?
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
D'you really wanna call?
Why?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
It's all right -- You're my guest.
'Bout seven.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Owe you what?
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
No doctor!
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Did ya get the license number?
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
Cost ya a buck.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
I say ya nothin'!
You can forget about sparring, kid.
A hundred an' thirty.
...The juice is climbin' every week.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
How'd you know?
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
I'm sure you are.
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
Make your teeth yella --
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
...What?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
Did ya win?
Here's the card?
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Fifty years, huh.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Don't you care what the people will say?
How I look out there, Mick?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Hey --
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
What's ya sister like to do?
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
What gaps?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Outta my house I want ya!!
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
What's this, Roger?
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
He's a riot.
So you decided to help him after all?
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Where is he?
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
You got the will in there, don't ya?
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Keep reading...
No better?
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Out--
Good heart, at what?
Farewell, my cuz.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
'Tis he.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
So thrive my soul--
By the hour of nine.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
And so did I.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Nurse.
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
So what's the deal?
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Not to me, you know that.
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Are you alright?
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
Who are you?  IRA?
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
Where's the case?
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
We'll double your price.
Do you have it?
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
And more importantly --
We'll die if we stay here!
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Then where is it?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
Then I guess we're set.
He's tough, your American friend.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
American.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Created?
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
Where to?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
Something like that...
Same thing, isn't it?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
Lovely, isn't it?
What's going on?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
What's going on?
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
I'm going with you.
Clearly.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
They don't have the package.
Give me a cigarette.
I'm not here very much.
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
Because I don't walk away.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
You son-of-a-bitch...
You speak French.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
What's the story?
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
You slept with her!
You put everything on the line because you...
Sort of!
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Don't spend it all in one place.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
No.  We can't.
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
I can't do that.
That's not what I mean.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
Well what are we supposed to do?
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
It's gonna be o.k.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Do you have everything?
We've got to go now, then.
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
What are you talking about?
It's too late...
And you're solid on that?
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Yeah I'm fine.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
A satellite dish?
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
And what's that?
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
Don't you have to be here?
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Shopping here?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
Dwayne please calm down!
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Is that the mail?
Did they ever find out who they were?
This whole place?
Don't you want it?
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Not in the trunk.
This isn't right...
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
What the hell is that?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Wait.
I got my sources.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
You bring American money?
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
What are you doing?
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Where are you going?
You.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
Slow down, baby.
She's getting undressed.
What's she doing?
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
I don't understand?
I wouldn't do that!!!
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
Yes.  We have heaven.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
Are you serious?
Very nice.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Vegas...
What is Mac out?
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
That your gate down there?
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
What is this?
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
You move well.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
I didn't know which side you were on.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Lee!  It's him!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
He was just doing his job.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
What about them?
You make the plate?
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
What?
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
Are you OK?
Want some?
Excuse me?
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Oh no, I dropped it.
I'm sorry, Lee.
You're killin' me here.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
How about a lift home?
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
You understand what I'm sayin'?
What?!
You a cop or something?
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
You got a boy friend in here yet? ŒCause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
Where do we find him?
My daughter.
Yes.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
I am so sorry about your men.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
Yes.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Bob's in a hurry.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
Or a vegetarian?
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
I have no idea what I'm doing.
And you are?
I think you'd look good in red.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
Really?
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
I'm a work in progress.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
No.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
I already explained about that.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
About a minute...?
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
I love you.  I love you.
I'm okay with that.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Yes, I did.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
I hate boats.
But it's on the water.
Am I what they had in mind?
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
I'll wait.
Happy New Year, darling.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
You go.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
About forever.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
Oh!
What's with you?
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
It's a sign --
You don't know who she was, Annie --
Becky?
What about the letter?
You're going to miss the train.
What are your plans in New York?
No, I know that part --
Are you Annie?
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Are his folks nice?
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Hello.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Why not?
What are you going to do, Sam?
What was it that made you know?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
It is not --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
You'll find out.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Do you want a fruit plate?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
Does red pepper go under R or P?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
What are you doing up?
Did you call that radio station again?
What's wrong with Annie?
What about camping?
How's Jonah taking it?
You're kidding --
He's ten.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
You're welcome to one.
Mornin'.
Well?
You haven't tried locking them up!
Got any more ideas?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
To the mine?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
This water's cold again.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
You all right?
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
How do you feel?
A meeting?
You mean you're ready to give up?
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Who wouldn't?
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
Yeah.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Oh God.
How?
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
: What are you up to?
It gets me through the day.
How much time do you have?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
What are you hiding, Danny?
I need my paycheck.
Why not?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Colette, go.
Who is it?
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
How the hell did we get this detail?
What time is it?
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
That's a good one.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Okay
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
What?
No one ever noticed?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
By not disgracing her memory!
Not bad.
But I just met you.
Come on, guys ...
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Cool it. We got business.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
Danny, I'm touched.
You think I'm a Judas?
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
You don't find that repugnant?
What the hell are you doing here?
You think this is funny motherfucker?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
He knows somebody ratted him.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Really?
Tom, quit fucking around.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
My sentiments exactly.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Sir?
A private, sir?
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
So, where are you from?
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
Jackson?
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Yes, sir.
What do you think?
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
He ain't Wade.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Watching.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
It seemed appropriate.
Good luck, Captain.
I wonder where they're going.
What about our grenades?
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
How about...?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Up.  We're moving out.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
What deal?
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
Who cares?
I usually like surprises.
Damn fool.  Sir.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
How do you do it?
You think he really believed it?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
No, no he's not.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Speak with my lawyer.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
I'll take the whole set.
Gee, it's easy.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
Please?
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Wait a minute.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I'll put this past my boss
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Visit her at the home.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
You like it?
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
What are you doing?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Goodnight.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
Morning.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
You're not listening to me.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Honey, it's not what you think.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
Hello.
Mom, please?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Are you busy on Friday?
Are you busy on Saturday?
I'll go.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
So what's your job this summer?
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Then call me tomorrow.
Me?  Sure I do.
Stop by later.
You have to meet Bess.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
It's okay, everybody does that.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
I don't think I am.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
Yeah.
It sounded like you did.
Yeah you do.
You shared it with a dick.
Then don't do it.
What do you want?
One more time would be nice.
How's it going?
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
The truck?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
Lloyd.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
We're full on bonded.
What -
What?
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
When?
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
Like this?
Oskar, good of you to come.
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
Don't ever do that to me again.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
I'll talk to him.
Eight hundred, give or take.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
I didn't do enough.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
Can't we hold him?
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
Shit.
Outside.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
It helped me realize one thing.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
I could use some therapy.
Where's Sid?
Lemme take you home.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
Two.
He hates Oliver Stone.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
Yeah?
You broke my heart.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
This is all too familiar.
Who are you?
Oh--a God complex
What do you mean?
What?
Yes, goddammit!
I have rehearsal.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
That was good.
Can I come with her?
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
Hello?
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
I'll be right back.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Jesus.  Hello?
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Asshole, Can't talk.
What do you mean?
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Oh yeah, how?
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Detective Kincaid?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Gale, your engine's still running.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Are you saying she was-
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
I know!
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
It is in my script.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
Where?
I didn't kill anybody.
Owwww...
How'd you do?
Duh... that's quick.
You ready to party hard tonight?
I thought she was dead.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
What are you doing here?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
You know what my dad will do to you?
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
So...
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
I wanna let go. I do...
Who did you call?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Why did you kill my mother?
What number are you trying to reach?
Hello.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Why do you want to know my name?
Nah, I don't think so...
Gotta go.
Listen, asshole...
Is this some kind of a joke?
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
Then he dies. Right now.
...please... no...
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
Afraid not.
You tricked me...
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
So is Dewey your real name?
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
She's tough.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
You're evil.
Where do you get this shit?
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Are you alone in the house?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
Can you see me right now?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Do you really think Billy did it?
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
What do you think?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
It's none of my business anymore.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
Where we headed?
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
Just keep leading the way.
You've made a good life for yourself...
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
Not here.
It's a bucket of vomit.
You think it was poison?
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
Is that clear?
This doesn't make any sense.
It's my wife.
Well?
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
You go to movies at least?
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
He just may be nuts enough.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
The fingerprints.
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
How did the fire fight end?
How was it?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
This is a waste of time.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
You stupid son of a...
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Where's the victory?
No.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
Tell me it's not true.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
Anything... anything missing or different.
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
How long have you lived here?
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
How's California?
But Mose Harper said...
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
You ain't goin'...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Unnt-meah!
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
Yes, sir.
What you want me to call you?
You want us to fire a shot if...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Hey! What's the idea...?
I think maybe we oughta...
Well, you're a widower now...
Stay out here.
How? She's even forgot her own language!
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
Comancheros...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
They never find that girl.
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Why else?
I have to cut his windpipe...
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
I'll do it myself.
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Martin, what-
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
How did you get me out of there?
Ellen Straub.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Well, look here!
Ah
You are a gentleman.
Oh…what have I done?
Follow that boat!
Tomorrow.
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
And your relations?
It's a comedy.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
No Juliet?!
Do you know it?
Now where? Will?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Cut round him for now.
Another little problem.
Kit
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Ethel.
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Your Majesty!
"I know not."
Will!
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
Like you, I found him not at home!
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
You can bring them with a word.
I do not know how to undress a man.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
Moonlight!
There is time. It is still dark.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
I have spoken with your father.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
And her lips?
What of her bosom?
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
You mean immoral.
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
I won't be able to.
That was good.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Not eating what?
Who?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Is this being recorded?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Well, is it?
Sorry to waste your time.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
And you like it?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Yes.
Did you know --
I thought you stopped going.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
So we'll meet him, then?
-- instead of what he is --
I think you're lying.
Have you seen Hugo?
He's got a car?
So?
Now?
Don't.
Unfeasible.
I don't want to. It's different.
Be careful.
Love and happiness for ever.
You know we're right.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Expecting anyone?
Aren't you going to answer it?
Are you all right?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
Don't you ever stop?
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
It's OK. There's no problem.
It's about the burglary.
Is this where no one stays?
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred pounds.
I thought you'd gone to work.
We already know. All about it.
What do we do here, David?
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
And that's why I think you fit in here.
What guy that died?
No.
Writing seems easy.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Shall I answer it?
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
Same as everyone else.
You can tell by the intonation.
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
That's George.
I just thought you'd like to know --
I don't know.
She did?
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I can see that.
What're you doing later?
Your husband?
Is she all right?
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
Hi.
But aren't you...
You going to answer it?
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
Are you in love with her?
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Did you hear me?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
What?
Yeah...
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
I went to school with her husband.
And you need money?
What sort of references do you have?
What!
Jesus...
I don't know. Probably not.
Where do you want to do this?
... I don't get it done often.
What's wrong?
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Why not?
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
It'll ruin everything.
Don't do it.
-- you are.
I don't know what gets into me.
-- where'd you go?
-- ass and legs --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
What's wrong?
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
Oh yeah?
Yeah?...
What with?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- you know better...
-- took a bus.
Hi, George.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
Now, George --
How are you, baby?
You're great.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Yeah.
When is that, George?
What?
A friend dropped me off.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Yes.
-- and take this with you.
What do you wanna know for?
-- please, baby --
George...
Stop it.
George...
What're you here for?
No.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
It's good you want to do something, George.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
I know it, I know it.
Well anyway...
You live like a pig.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Me!
What about Jackie?
She's nothing but a whore.
You're home.
No you won't.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Who were you talking to?
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Here.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
-- you phony asshole --
Poster-Kleiser.
That's right.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
You're really a love -- you sure?
He does?
I would say so, yes.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
But why Egypt?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
George? Was he alone?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- there's not much room --
-- yes, Jill.
You seem disappointed.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Do you have children?
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Are you having a good time?
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Yes.
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Yes?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Yes.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Red Rum.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Shall we go into the living room?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Tony.
What sort of injury did he have?
Sure.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Who?
How?
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
No charge?
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
And you didn't see anything at all?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me!  Please...
Give me the bat.
I'm gonna go now.
Have any trouble finding us?
Only in a very general way.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Yes. Go away.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Mom-!
Your mom's not around, is she?
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
But how?
But I'm fearful!
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
How are you doing.
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
No... it's fine.
Thanks.  A lot.
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Where did that come from?
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
What is it, Mary?
Like this place?
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Babies
A cigarette?
You have to help me
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
We need experience.
Bobs
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Who are all these people?
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Goddamn it!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
It has come to pass.
And all those like you.
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
What's wrong with my life?
Sometimes it's not enough!
You're my Olympic event.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
But... wait a minute...
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
But -- why?
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
I just need a few more weeks,
I am?
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Then one day they find you.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
Well?
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
A sweater.
It should be here any minute.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
I'd rather sing than do anything!
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
She's... she's a nun.
We both missed.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
Listen to what you say....
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
Where are we going?
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
What is it?
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
Why... why are you like this?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Other people?
My suitor?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
Thank you.  No.  Here...
Must I hear this?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
I apologize if I worried you.
Blood.
My God... what has happened?
What... what are you doing... ?
If you think I am behind this, say it.
Where are we going?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
What... what are you doing?
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
She has confessed.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Can I help you?
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
Yeah.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Yeah.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
You got that shit right.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Don't hit that boy no more.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
They let you out?
How come?
Do you like to play football?
They still around, your folks?
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Hey Karl, you off work?
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
What do you mean?
Why not? It died?
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
It was fun, anyhow.
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Yes sir.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
I know he does.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
I'm ye boy.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
Karl, you up?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
I'll be.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
You scared me.
Yes ma'am.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Why are you here now?
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Do you have family here?
Naw, I ain't.
I done et just a little bit ago.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
Okay.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Where will he go?
Will he be supervised?
Yes.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What happened?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
What'll it be, Auggie?
What about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
It's yours?
A photographer ...
But they're all the same.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
So what did he say when he called?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
I'm all ears.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
She looks just like you.
There's just one thing I want to know.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
It's for you.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
So I can get my job back.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Does it hurt?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
And have you mended them?
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
What are you talking about?
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
So what's the time?
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Of course. Where else?
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
Why?  If they could never take title.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
It is.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Closer to eight.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
You don't believe in God anymore.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
I did.  Boy.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
You think so?
Cigarette?
You always run with the well open?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
I believe so.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
For certain, no.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
You're welcome.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
What happened?
We're not?
But suppose he loses?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
With me?
Nellie told us about it.
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
I think they got me.
You going to call the police?
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
What are you doing?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
Blow where?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
What message?  What motorboat?
What are you doing with my flowers?
WHAT?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Like when?
Not that, you idiot.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
She sings, too.
We'll take a rain check.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
I'm a very sick girl.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Here you are, Sugar.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
His yacht?
I'm a what?
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
What for?
Brand new.
Where did you girls play before?
What's wrong with us?
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
You must be quite a girl.
I don't like no witnesses.
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
Oh?
And you'll be in all evening?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
Tell what?
We understand.
That so?
Yeah.
Men!
I want mine to wear glasses.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
What makes you so sure?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
I wish you'd make sure.
I'm not interested at all.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Why?
Oh?
Would you mind moving along, please?
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
Oh - in here.
What a beautiful fish.
What thing?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
What else is there for me? 
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Really?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
We got different information.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Christ, Amy.
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
I don’t think I can go through with this.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
Hey.
You know what? I’m not having this conversation right now.
Wow. You look beautiful.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
Huh?
Who’s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
I’ll just check into a hotel.
I look like a total wanker, don’t I?
You heading to the train station?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
Nothing.
Hey, you!
That was a long time ago.
Brilliant.
You think we look like we’re trying too hard.
What color are my shoes?
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
It’s hard to explain.
Come on.
Don’t they have a limit at those machines?
But nothing did.
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
I should go.
Hey, Sal.
Dad!
“Not yet...”
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
What is it you do again?
What do you say to that?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
And so you did your job, right?
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
You bet we is!
Where's everybody?
You feel alright today, Daddy?
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
You hurt, Daddy!?
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
You know somethin', Daddy?
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
'Bye, Mama...
Any sign of Sounder?
What is it, David Lee?
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Whatcha wanta order?
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
How's the weather out there?
Well, let's get to work!
I just got out here!
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
What is this?
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Cartman?!
Mph rmpmh rm.
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Mrphmmmph!!!
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Oh yeah.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
Hello there, children!!
Who are you, kid?
Purpre mama!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Yes I am!
Mph rmph rm!
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Oh my God...
It's so very cold...
That was sweet!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
This is sweet!!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Thank you, Kenny.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
And Bill?
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
The F word?!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
How is the children's progress?
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
Fight the power!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Who's my cream puff?
You know I do.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
What is it?
Anna...
Oh, thank you.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
You're certain of that?
So, are you on for the next one?
You gotta think of your old age.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
Is that clear?
We're going to die.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
He certainly is polite.
You're ready for the real thing?
Do you want some advice?
And what are you going to do?!
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
I'm in the bridge.
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
So I've been told.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
I'm going back for Taylor!
Well now what are we gonna do!
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Is it safe for human transport?
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Hey, you still here?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
I hate fuckin' opera.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
What do you think I can do?
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Who gave it to you?
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
He's the guy Buzz.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
How's that?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
What if he wants to get out?
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
Get that outta your mouth!
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Where did your brother escape from?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
Do you talk with your mom?
Come on, bargain with me.
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
Why did you come back?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
You're really pissing me off.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Very good, busyboy.
Who identified the body?
Get out of there!
Wait a minute --
Thank you, Colonel.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
How deep is he?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
What is it, Norman?
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
Wait a second --
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
It's not sucking, sir.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.
Yes, sir.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
Some sort of lead or something.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
How can he be missing?
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Where'd this come from?
What do you mean -- not normal?
Wait a minute.
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
Norman.
In Edmunds' things.
You said something to him, didn't you?
Where are you going in such a hurry?
But I don't know how --
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
That wasn't in there before.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
I don't know.
P-a-r-a-s-o...
What's that?
What's wrong, Norman?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
I promise --
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Top shelf, is it?
Get away from me!
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Just in time, too.
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
C'mon.
C'mon, Norman.
Our answer.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
I can't believe that, Harry.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
No.  I didn't say that.
What is that?  That noise?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You don't remember that?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Fine.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
You know how to work this thing?
How's that working out, by the way?
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
What does Norman already know?
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Beth and Harry?
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Was it a military crash?
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
Well, we'll see...
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
Who are you anyway?
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
They use the Bogan Force.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
Have you been checked out?
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
Here come six more... grid two!
There are only three or four left.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
I found it... It's just not there.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
You always told me you couldn't do human...
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
WHERE IS IT ?
Johnny, wait...
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
I'm sorry, Carmen.
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
None at all... We won.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
He's nothing like you.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
You talk to Carl ?
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Cover me.
It stinks, you goin.
Way to go, amigo !
C'mon...
You used to dance...
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
Oh, my, what's that ?
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Mr. Rasczak.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
Best in the Fleet !
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
What do you think you're doing ?
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
The examination is a normal function.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
What does that mean?
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Granted.
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Captain, what's the next move?
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
'Commander' Decker?
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
One hundred kilometers...
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
Child...!?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Cal...
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Well, it had sentimental value.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
But why the dalmation?
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Goodbye.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
How can you <u>say</u> that?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
I...
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Uh huh.
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Great.  Who is it...?
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
...yes.
That's right...
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
That's something a man could do...?
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
We on for tomorrow night?
Drama Group?
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
I've been thinking.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
He's on the ph...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
The prices are going up.
Are you all right...?
Tell it with...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
Are you Okay?
<u>Bobby</u>...
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
You do...?
I'm very sorry to...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
Get him on the phone.
Look.
But not that <u>way</u>...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
What...?
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...I...
Wally...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
An artist of your caliber...
I know...
Hello.
You show Claire these sketches?
Why not?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Where you off to?
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
Arrest him.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
I had a witness I would.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I know the feeling.
I want to make a good film.
What's the...
Why?
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
I've got a date.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
My oh my.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
It's just a formality.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
Yeah?
Do something.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
Why?
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
Like who?
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
Wow.  Who's that for?
What's Thursd...
Actually.  I could only help him.
And what do you do wh...
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
This is my house too!
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
No they're not.
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
That I do.  Always will.
Mommy's sick, guys.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You say that like I don't know that.
And when did that pass?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Something's up wi...
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
It's a huge moment in their life --
We...
Yet another spaghetti night.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
Machines do not EAT message.
Yeh?
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
I need practice.
I'm sorry, I just...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
I don't, but...
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
She's devastated.
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...

Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Where you goin'?
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Marty, ignore him.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Nice to have you here.
Really? How many?
Must've been hard being poor.
Who is Jesus?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
No, you don't.
The camerawork's nice.
Don't even joke about that!
We used pull.
Was anyone in my room today?
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
I can read it to you.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Hello, Vi.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
It's over there.
Ni...
No.
I dunno...
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
Anything I might know about?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
I do.
How many?
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Is it loaded?
You know...I like you.
What for?
Can I see what you have so far?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Let's move it we got company!
I have a lighter!
How well do you know this place?
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Well?
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Just what the hell is he talking about?
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
I have your word, Mister President?
What's the meaning of this?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Yes?
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Yes, sir.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
You know the regulations well, Major.
I don't think so, sir.
I'm trying to, sir.
I guess so.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Do you think they would cheat?
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
Roger, maintain.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
What else could it be?
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Maximum ECM.
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
A through H is correct.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Roger.
They can't touch us at this height.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
Primary circuit is live.
Release first safety.
Master safety.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
What happened?
He's dead, all right.
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
That's the point.
I said that's the point!
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
We are?
Mn-hm.
Um-hm.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
That was really great.
Yeah!
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Uh, home, you know.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Your a nurse?
Any gunshot victims?
Yeah.
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Wait. Hey, man.
She's dead?
Bullshit.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Yeah.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Come on man.
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
You better! Yes!
He paid you man.
It's safe, come on.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
You could do it.
Thanks, man!
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Come on. Inside.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Yes.
Yeah. So, what about you?
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
See ya later.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Why? Because I give a shit?
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
This is my home.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Jeff! Come up here!
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Oh! Trim it!
Was that supposed to be me?
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Yes, you asshole.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
It was a racial incident.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Come on.
What?
Where are you going?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
You're unbelievable.
Hey, Pony.
No, it's not...
Yeah.
The prom. That's funny.
Sorry.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
So you think I should?
For a while.
So who are you?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
Look Pakeesa...
I hope you're happy!
Like?
You do not want me to do your cover.
You're not serious.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Soon.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Just one?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
So where are you?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Leave him alone, Tim.
What?!
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Another sex dream?
Hello?
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
Hi, Jack.
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Oh... What are you working on?
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Hat-trick?
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Oh no...
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Don't use big bills!
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
You got that big retarded girl down there?
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
They could kill you.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Give me your coat.
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
I was afraid of that.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Why not?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Yes, I did.
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
What's the matter, Norma?
I wouldn't know.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Just a minute, you!
We've made a lot of pictures together.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
I will not have it butchered.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
What scene?
Cut away from me?
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Don't bend back like that.
What are the notes?
What's the matter with you?
Go away.
Did she read the script?
When did he say it, Norma?
He must be quite a guy.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
I'm the greatest star of them all.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
Is that so!
What doctor?
Uh-huh?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
A Storm Dragon?
Home?
At last. Ultimate Power.
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
We can't do that.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
I don't love you any more.
Away. From you.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
Before you go...
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
Nurse! Nurse!
Do you have any theories about last night?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
Where is Earth?
She did that deliberately.
No thanks. You go on.
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
What is this place?
I was on Earth...
That horrible woman!
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
You're going to take me back?
You can use the wand.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Goodbye...
What?
What are you talkin' about?
Tuesday.
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
I just can't stand this.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Me??
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
I can never get a way from it.
He really was!
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Gus?
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
How do you do that?
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Why do I have to do this?
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
There's no rush.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
I thought you'd never get here.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
I don't know you, lady.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
Where's the light switch?
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
Mr. White, the next number, please?
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Jimmy, how's the -
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
It is kinda romantic.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Where were you?
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
I'm listening.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
Lois, someday --
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
Gee. But --
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
You'll have to pack quickly.
Mush!  Mush!
This way Lex.
Why didn't you go before we left?
I think he said a "curl."
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...

You must be freezing.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
You are master of all you survey.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
I know, but  --
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
Mother...
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Not...gray.
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
You're just jealous.
Is that what they're calling him?
Listen...thank you.
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
Nuts. He made it.
See?
I'm going to bed.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
They stop for nothing.
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
What're you writing, Lois?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
No! You couldn't imagine -
Do as I say. Let go!
Wha'...what are you doing here?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
How much do you weigh?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Can you really see through anything?
What color underwear am I wearing?
Where do you hail from?
There.
I gave him steady employment --
I gave him this new face.
Is that real enough for you?
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Luthor  --
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
And what does he do again?
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
She's in trouble?
I'm...so sorry.
Alison.
My name is...
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
I'll be back around nine.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Because it's what we have to do.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
You're leaving.
Why did you do that, Billy?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
He knows that?  Billy?
You hate it.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
And winter?
Nicole!
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Nicole?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
I have no questions.
What about Doreen?
Have they ever been busted?
How old is she?
Is this it?
Here we go.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
I tested positive.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
What for?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Oh God, I'm scared.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
Yes.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Are you a reporter?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
What's that?
How do you like it, Nicole?
Pretty slick, eh?
Do you like the colour?
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
Will the police do anything to her?
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
But of course...
Did she accept?
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
You told him that?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Not being partial, are you?
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Match me, Sidney...
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
He means that much to you...?
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
And who's feet is she on now?
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
I thought he would.
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
What would you think of me if -
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
Did you now?  On which bounce?
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
We stick in each others craw.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Can I stop by my house?
You sure?
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
No!
It must end here... or I am the future.
Easy money!
So she's pretty cool, huh?
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Mom?  You okay?
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
I know!
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
Can it be destroyed?
You look like handmade shit.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
I have detailed files.
It's finally over.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
And no elbows on the table!
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
What the hell are they doing?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
Did you call someone you knew?
Your guess is as good as mine.
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Who warned you?
If it's too hot, open your tie.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
Von der Null?
That's an outrageous lie!
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Do you know what that is?
Okay, so what is it?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Yes, you remember.
Show me.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
Anything else?
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
I caught one, back there.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
About what?
Bag some Z's?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Is this enough?
My whole life has been combat.
Don't say that.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
I bet you're ticklish.
Sarah.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
Did you play recently?
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What's with him?
Oh, God... !
You've got to be kidding.
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
There's got to be a flashlight.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
There's a ladder here.
I'll wait.
This is C.R.S.
Goodnight.
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
What is this!?
What are you doing... ?
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
What did you say?
What the fuck are you... ?
It's mine...
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Nicholas...
I didn't know what else to call you.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
I redecorated.  What about you?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
Trust me.  Call that number.
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
Tell me where we're going.
Yeah, almost...
What have they been doing to you?
The phone's dead.
Do you know how to change a tire?
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Get rid of them.
Hm?
Didn't I give you two?
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Goodnight.  See you home.
What's the trouble?
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Your ex-wife.
I don't like her.
What?
Hey... !
What's happened...
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
It's not going to hold your weight.
You're not telling us something.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
All the carvings.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
What happened after you smelled it?
Someone is playing with you.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
She needs help.
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Why?
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Not for you, clearly.
It's not a compliment.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
Italian?
What's the matter?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
Man knows what he likes.
Edward Rama?
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
Boomerang.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
Huh?
What?
Has he?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
I've been wondering something.
Do you have any friends, man?
Had a feeling it was you.
How d'you mean?
What was that, then?
Here, are you always this sarky?
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
What line is he in.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
Are you serious.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Won't he be looking for you about now?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Yeah, that's right.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Which kind?
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
There is?
How we gonna get that lucky?
So why would he want to see you.
You know her?
Is Valentine here?
I miss my kids.
You've made it ... brighter.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Thanks.  You, too.
Ann--
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Hello, Mr Crane.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
But more or less.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
...she can go up there.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
Sure.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
How ya doin', Ed?
...That's quite a wife you got there.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
What kind of man *are* you?
Rye.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
I don't know what's going on. I--
Should I... should I tell you why?
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
Yeah.
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
I'm fine.
Coffee, Ed?
Ed, how're you holding up?
Yeah.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Jesus...
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
You don't got a headache?
Mr...?
...You're Ed Crane?
Hello!
Doesn't bother me.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
Sweet Jesus!
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Fifteen... what's next?
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
How big is the sub-basement?
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
What does it say?
Curious.  There's something missing.
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
This room sucks.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Shut them up!
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
That's impossible.
What kind of egg is it?
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
That's not what I saw.
They're all heavily armed.
Genetic damage?
Wounded?
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
Is there another way around?
What happened?
We're not going to make the storage room!
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
You want to book the flight?
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
Are we talking Emmies?
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
What's he doing?
Lauren, right?
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
I think I'm mixed up in something.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
What exactly?
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
I know.
What's the hurry?
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
--Darling--
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
I think you better tell us.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
You've been back to Dallas?
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
What is it you find incredible?
You've got something to show me.
This man's still alive.
How can this be?
Of what?
Who?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Have you examined them?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
Who sent you?
And what's that?
Those people were already dead.
You know my work?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
Negotiating with whom?
You found something?
What do you think?
Jesus, Mulder...
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Something's not right...
What? What are you talking about?
Why?
I wake you?
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
What did you find?
What are my choices?
You think they went left?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
Yeah, well they may this one.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
Agent Mulder --
Are we being watched?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Where is he?
Let me out. Stop the car.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
She adores you.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I do it all the time!
I'd be there for him.
Sing a song of sixpence.
...a pocketful of rye.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
Agent Novak?
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
You think you can do this, don't you?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
You sure about this?
I heard Julia and John got married.
He's mine?
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
They're hungry.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Agent Novak.
That's a secret.
So?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Den leuten.
You were awfully good.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
Can I hear you?
Tell me about him.
When...what did you do?
...and buried him.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
I wish I knew.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
How do you know?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Joseph Harbin...
He works in a military hospital.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
They are - private - letters.
Yes.
My name is Calloway.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
Him dying like that.
Miss Schmidt.
Get the next plane.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
I suppose you don't believe me.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Fifty yards right down there.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Be sensible, Martins.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
Zane Grey.
Mr. Crabbin.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Hello, Harry.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
...were of you.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
...your address?
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Kurtz.
The Roumanian?
...this time.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
A shark fin?
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
One kilometer
Did you sleep well?
I think so too.
Exactly.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
How come you know all this shit?
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Which is what?
You're not in school? What do you do?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
That's a much easier game.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
Is it okay if I record this?
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Give me a reason not to.
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
I always won.
It was a nine millimeter.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
Think about your father. Your sister.
Don't tell me what I --
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
Do you feel you're making progress here?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
What are you doing here?
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Which was his room?
Which one were you aiming at?
Shut up. Fuck you....
Open it up.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
When do you want it to go off?
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
Where do you think you're going?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
So what?
Are you out of your mind?!
Are you going to keep it?
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
What's happened??
It can't be true!
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
The Italian, I presume?
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
The Mamma's there too.
You risk your life when you cross the street.
How did it happen?
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
And where did you say you were from?
And... does the voice come back?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
That's good.
Madame...
Why?  Are they what's most important?
What?
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
I'm concentrating.
But what brought you to Sicily?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
You look adorable.
How can you tell it's a female?
Hello?
You sure?
Jacques...?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
Why?
You've got to tell me what happened?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
It's his heartbeat.
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
... And those?
I'll go see how he's doing.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
So why the long face?
Please. Will you help me?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
We do!
Esther!
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
How do we bypass it?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
Hammer, you alright?
What are you doing?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Is he in love with you?
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
I'm sick.
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head —- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ——
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
What did they say before the bad card came up?
Oh, that's so interesting!
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
What do you do now?
State hunters?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
That's easy. Me.
That's easy. Me.
You're too good to me.
Clo-Clo?
You look swell in that three—alarm number --
Who was the other man?
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
That might depend on where you’re going.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
I found this at your brother’s.
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
How dare you...  You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Laurence!
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing don’t learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn’t suit you! Who knew I’d found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, who’d want to make sure it didn’t fall into the wrong hands?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you’d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you’re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid’s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? “Leon does his own prints. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’”.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it’s the way you say them...
You’re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he’d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don’t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didn’t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
Where is that?
Do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
So you did talk about it, huh?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
I’ve got work tonight, Jane.
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it’s there with...
Piss off!
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
Problems?
Where is Friedman?
This car needs petrol.
At what time will you be available?
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Is she on the phone?
I can’t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What’s your sister’s number?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Huh... I guess you ain’t quite ready for civilisation yet... I’ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you’re on your way.
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
What about which girlfriend?
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
Alors?
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Three...
Why did you kill him?
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
When they realise I’m missing...
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
It's a miracle she's not dead!
Better today than tomorrow.
I also need someone who can read and write.
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
We must sound the retreat!
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
Jeanne's alive!
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
I can't read.
Do you have a sword?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
No, I... I held it up to...
Arrest them!
The English??
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
How old are you?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
The voice was in your cell?
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
Thanks be to God.
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
So how would you put it?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
Supposing she's an assassin?
My captains have sworn their support.
5,000 gold crowns.
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
And... what does Jeanne think?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
Who gave you that horse?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
Who... who are you...?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
"Love your enemies"...
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
You think you are ready now?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Only God knows the answer to that.
I don't want to wait for his call.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Someone you know?
A beauty. Who is she?
I'm going to get a doctor.
Dorota!
Don't worry, it won't last long.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
What did I tell you?
For what? For my tie?
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
I'm on the run!
Have you seen this?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
You sell anything?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
What's the matter? Are you sick?
What are you reading?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
But I want to help, I want to.
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Out of Warsaw.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Careful! Watch his hand.
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
I worry for you.
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
No, words. You have never heard words?
What?
Play a gig.
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
You're late.  Where you been?
How much did ya lose?
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
Then why ain't he dead?
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Lonnegan after you, too?
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
Who are you?
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
It isn't any better.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
And you were gonna pay me back?
Well, what did I tell ya?
You stayin' in or not?
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
What happened to your face?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
What is this?  I got work to do.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Any luck?
How are you?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
And don't ever try to see me again.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Is your father still in there?
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Come on in.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
But it isn't bad weather now.
Nothing.
Have you got a pistol permit?
Who's is it?
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
Are you kidding?
You mean that body-----?
I said he hadn't written me.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
You did!
Good morning --
Have a shot?
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
Why, you said...
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
I don't like him.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
That's my business.
Did you get my money?
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
How are you?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
How are you?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Where's Gilbert?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
What's that?
Why do you say that?
By the way, how is your father's side?
How many drinks have you had?
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Finished with these?
Hello... send him up.
Aren't you hot in that?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
So am I.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
What are you going to do?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You dog!
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
Why not?
What are you going to do?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Who do you think did it?
Mimi!
You worked here?
Where are you going?
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
He's not so--
Not much of a pass.
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
Get off him.
Stop it!
Then step aside.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
So you can give us away?
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
At-at-at-at-at.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
They'll shoot us!
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
What!?
You didn't step on any mine.
It's a mine, isn't it?
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
I don't hear any--
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
Must be a compartment.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
Why do I have to stay down here?
How!?
We can't just leave him.
What do you think our chances are?
I pick that way.
Just let me rest for a second.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Can't you--
What do we do?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
I didn't say that.  I never said--
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Well?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
He's not slowing.
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Yeah!  Yeah!
How long we going to keep this up.
So?
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
It's got a bottom.
You down?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
HUMMMM.....
Control ON.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
I'm not hungry.
When?
I have to... he's a G-34
Look, food!
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What are you doing?
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
Are you all right?
Who?  Who's leaving?
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
What's going on?
Where's LUH?
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
Right now.
What?
What are you doing here?
...and you're not lost now?
How do you know?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
I don't know.
What was that....
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
I knew him.
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
You guys seem pretty tight.
What's up?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Should we head for the Interstate?
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Something round, two wires ...
What do you think?
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
You got it.
Any word?
Lane oil...
What do ay say?
Jesus...
You okay?
What's the matter?
Drop it.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
Prints?
What about the ballistics report?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
He is!
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
Vice... Jesus.
What was it this time?
Reilly, Vice. I-
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Yes.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
Eleven o'clock! 
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
And harems ... ?
Nice day, Major.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I hope you find the figures correct.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
Very well, m'sieu.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
You say I am a crook.
Monescu.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Who?
The tennis player?
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
The pepper, too?
Thank you, Baron.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
They're all right, aren't they?
Filiba ...
Five, seven, and nine--
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Lily, you must listen to me.
And you--
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Eighteenth century.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
Good night. 
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
No--yours, madame.
I'm crazy about you!
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Then why do you want to go?
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Thirty-three--
You look beautiful.
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
To me he seems rather nervous.
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
But you're the more intelligent one.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
How much time?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
You're precious to me, Rose.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
You know somebody?
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
The fall alone would kill you.
How cold?
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
And these were drawn from life?
And...?
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
I don't know the steps.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
This is horseshit.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
Will this work?
I'm not going without you.
It's getting quiet.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Don't come any closer.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
Rose, get in the boat!
Anya!
It would be a nice change from you.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Good afternoon--
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Will you pardon me?
No-o!
Where'd you get it?
What did you want a gun for?
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Nice lines--
Like her paint job?
How about giving me another coat?
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Married?
Tell me.
Yes?
A little.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Who with?
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Not here--follow me around the shed.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
This is a business trip!
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Inspector McKinney.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Thank you, sir. 
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
It's your deal.
How's your mother feeling?
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
I'm going to the show--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Hello, young fellow!
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Yes--Me--in person!
Hello, Denby!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Am I a member of this club?
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Very good, Mary--
What's the matter, Mary?
What happened to you?
What for?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
You leave the kid alone.
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
He's certainly good-natured.
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
What d'you think of the singer?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
A peace officer... Impressive man
Come on, you...
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Here, Doc.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Not exactly...
Very cosmopolitan.
He's drunk.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
So what does he want?
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
Praise Jesus!
Just answer.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
I have to go.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Oh, all right.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Florentino!  He's getting away!
I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?
Well how do we look?
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
Get down, boy.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
That a fact?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Look pretty rough.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
What about all these saloons?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
I'm sure they will.
I'd rather die alone.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Wait a minute -
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
What about the uranium?
Just - say it. Say it just once.
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Sidney Winch, meet -
Married?
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Bourbon. Neat.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
- Shut up!
No?
If I were you -
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
... Yes???
You won't get away with this!
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
The back-up does the same thing.
He brought that up from the wreck.
Is the helicopter ready?
Please sir. Please -
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Will it go off?
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
What is that?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Your feet are cold.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I'm worn out.
What did you put on it?
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
How is everybody?
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
That smells like fresh coffee.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
When did you talk to Harry?
What are you doing?
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Yeah?!
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Here!  In the car!
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
What are you doing over there?
Hello-o-o...
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
Can!
THAT is Sid!
I could have stopped him.
Spaceship.
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Woody, stop it!!
Come on, this way!
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Oh, that is disgusting.
What?
Hey!!
Oh, no!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
That ain't no happy child.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
A lunchbox?!
They're getting bigger.
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Bad news?!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
You're only a young thing.
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
He'll murder you when he finds out.
How long has -
How much?
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
Did you get it?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
How long have you known?
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Did you meet the President?
Hi.
What's up?
Helena --
What if every country legalized at the same time?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
What do we do?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
You will help me with my other problem.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
One question.  How did you find about this?
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
My work keeps me young.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
Hello.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Who do we interface with on their side?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
What?
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Great.
What?
What do you want?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
There's no need.
Clear?
Have you got any gear on you?
Good luck, Spud.
Exactly.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
You don't know, do you?
The park?
Oh no, don't even mention it.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
So?
That's hardly a substitute.
Excellent.
This had better be good.
It's the great outdoors.
What do you see as your main strengths?
Qual se tu?
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
But the shuttle-
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Can we have it quiet?
Bob?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Your pain runs deep.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
But he does seem familiar?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
I am here, Captain.
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
Spock.
...mark two.
What is this?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
Your vision?
About the ship...

And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
Spock?
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Sybok, we must find a way...
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Hi, Alan.
Your old files -- ?
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
For what?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Oh. Anything else?
I'm your program?
This town's full o' live ones.
Yes!
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
What, just the three of us?
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
What about our friend - Sark?
Hey... you guys OK?
A User -- in our world?
There's another beam!
How did you do that, Flynn?
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Watch it!
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Hey... !
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Yes, MCP.
Wait...I need that...
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
New guy...
You think we can make it there?
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
That's not true, honey--
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
Dad, how come you know the words?
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Harry?  HARRY?!
Thanks dear.
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
There's another guy, still in the car.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
She's still at my house.						*
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
I thought this look like your work.
My husband is a good man.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
What did you tell him?
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
How long have you been a member of his faction?
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
What were you doing there?
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
What does she do?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Like one?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
And you chased one?
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
The forager's back.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
Tell him we gotta go.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
The letter I sent.
Thanks a lot.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
Four hundred bucks.
I love Janis.
She OD'd, didn't she?
You mean she got a bad batch?
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Who?
A real live pimp?
What did he do to Arlene?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
Why Cancoon?
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
What?
Where the fuck is that bitch?
Who the fuck are you?
Clarence?
You comin' to L.A.? When?
What?
Clarence sent a letter?
Money problems?
You're really in love, aren't you?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
What's this acting class guy's name?
The zoo.
In case of what?
Do you really mean it?
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Where's everybody else?
Elliot.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
I can, but I don't.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
What do you want from me?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
What are you talkin' about?
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Do you believe him?
He'll wear a wire?
Nicholson and I.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
You gotta hold this for me.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
Him?  You saw that man?
Women will want to get to know you...
I understand.  There'd be no point.
That's him.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Change what?
Do you know why you're here, James.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
July.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
They're keeping an eye on me.
The guy was a total fruitcake.
We need gas.
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
What are you talking about???
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
What....???
What...???
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
Jo...Jose????
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
But you know what's real now?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
He was fully sedated!
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
He no!
That a fact?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Any parting words of wisdom?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
It's nonsense.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Where to?
One way, or round trip?
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
But he's dead.
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Hey!
How much time?
What time is it now?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
What you want?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
Do you have to call me that?
Jesus.
Thank you, John.
You're not from around here, are you?
Least you can leave.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
Where'd you learn to do that?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
I don't know how.
John, please--
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
Let's do it here.
To get my car.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
John, throw me the keys.
No.  I swear it.
Husband . . .?
I have half a mind to--
What happened to your hand?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
Now what can I do for you?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
That's a bit much.
No.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
You think that's a lot of money?
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
I came for Grace.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Two-hundred dollars.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
Kids.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
Got any cold soda?
I call the policia.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
More or less.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Who the hell is this!?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
You've got to be--
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Would you?
Talk?  About what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
Shhh! Liar.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Got any requests?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Twenty-after-ten.
Hey.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
Two-hundred.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
What you want?
You've been around.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
A medicine man?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Is that why you're with him?
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
You'd never understand.
Yeah.
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
What do you mean?
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
I can't see it.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
And I love you too.
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
I need a ticket.
Out of here.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
Son of a bitch!
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Proceed.
How old is Jeb?
I'm listening.
What about Jeb?
I don't think I got the job in New York.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Oh shit...
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
I remember you.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
Would you like to try going--
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Why?
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
It's for last week's game.
Yes.
He's kind of a miracle.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
I'm going to go in.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
Twelve years.
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
He's coming ain't he?
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
I thought... you was an angel.
Oh. Yeah.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Uh... a little, maybe.
Yeah?
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Like I said, I...
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
Duke.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
But... if he doesn't miss?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
A sign on him?
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
Then... what?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
About what?
What for?
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
You're goin' back with him?
Did you kill him?
They takin' water?
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
He's in there.
Is it him?
Take a drink, Kid.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
Yeah?
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Who's he?
Hullo, paw.
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Far enough.
Jesus.  You done this before?
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
That ain't what I mean.
Yeah.
There was ninety-one million -
What was the money for?
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
He's alright.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
What fence? Who?
How are they going to do it?
What is it Keaton?
Keaton, I can't just -
How are you, Keaton?
The answer is no.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
We're on vacation.
What do you mean I can't see him?
I'11 find him.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
You got him wrong.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
What call?
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
You're not safe on your own.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
... tell me about this case.
... he wants to testify ...?
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Ed Concannon.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
What book is that?
How old are you?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Mr. Concannon...?
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
I do.  Yes.
She getting good care over there?
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
And you wrote that...
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
Who are you protecting, then?
Then why don't you testify?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
Maybe I can do something right.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
You're pressuring yourself...
Dr. Gruber.
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
...four years ago...
What are you doing in New York...?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
She told me.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Who told you that?
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
I told you! Right here!
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Thank you again. Good-night.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
I don't like it!
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
You don't even want to touch me.
The color of your hair...
Where shall we go for dinner?
Ernie's?
That's what I had in mind.
But why? Why here?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
Meet again, sometime.
And no birds sing.
Would you like a drink of water?
Have you been here before?
No, I can't tell you!
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
What else?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
No, don't go away!
Where's your husband?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Why?
Where?
Madeleine --
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Is there something I can do for you?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
How do you know? Personal experience?
What do you mean?
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Well?... what'll you do?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
How's your love life, Midge?
Well?
Step number two.
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
Well...
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
Can't do what?
Name one.
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
Why?
This is pathetic.
I have plenty of friends.
She's got no fucking pulse.
What do you think you are doing?
We have to call the ambulance.
Are you sure this was an accident?
Bury her out in the desert.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
Sun rises at 5:52.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
What is your problem?
Who? What are you talking about?
Don't snap at them!
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
We'll be ready Adam.
Real times.
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
If anything ever happens to me...
Have you thought about what I said?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Okay. Hi.
Yup.
That's right.
That's right.
No I don't.
Your investment ideas never work out.
But not tonight.
I got her arm.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
What's goosed?
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
She's dead. Call somebody!
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
What?
What's your point?
Regarding what?
Just do it.
Take care of business.
My what?
The hell I did!
Not true.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
Then what do they have?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
There's my point exactly.
Take Mexico.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
Stop it!
Are we supposed to?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
What do you mean, you think so?
Why did you forget the tent check?
What else have you forgot?
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
Time out.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
How much?
Seating problems.
You go down there.
I need your help.
Do you love me?
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
That's sweet.
How late?
What about the chairs?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
What's the word on the chairs?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
No way.
Who's dead?
Call the police.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
Everything okay?
I don't care for him.
Where did you get that?
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
That ought to be about the end of that.
I have no idea.
Greenpeace.
Pup corn?
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
The post-Vegas Man.
We will.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
Give them to Refugio.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Come down here, you scamp.
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
You must think I am a monster.
You must think I'm mad.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
Is it all right?
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
She's mad.
If you wake first, wake me up.
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
Well... is it so urgent?
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Yes. Why?
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
What's going on, Moncho?
Forgive me if I have offended you.
What happened to me?
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty—four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
What the hell happened?
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
You need a maid.
My God...
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You actually listen to all those tapes?
A little less than yesterday.
Go to hell.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
What are you doing?
Give me your wrist.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
What does that mean?
Don't worry about it, all right?
Relax. I know what you meant.
What the hell's going on?!
What did you do to those people?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
See something?
That's why I'm asking.
You okay?
What do we do now?
You and me have nothing in common.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you——
There you go —— best seat in the house.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
...on the way in.
What about it?
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...
Mr. President, this is St...
...mmm?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
It won't hold.
What crisis?
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
Yes
<u>Who</u>?
We'll be back tonight.
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
No rain.
And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some <u>Harvest</u> Festival, something...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
...uh huh...
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
Courage, Mom.
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY.  AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN.  WHO TAKES THEM.  MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE.
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
Hello...?
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Why do people go to war?
...Yes.
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
Dartmouth
China.
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
Who?
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
"The Country Is At War." 
We don't need an Act Two.
W...what?
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
Where is he now?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...

 A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
Mmm.
Wake up.
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
Well, <u>that</u> ain't very butch, is it?
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.

It's tough to rhyme.
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
Long's you git me back for the beans...
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
Yup.
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
He's lying.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Sell?
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
You sure about this FAA announcement?
Don't start, alright.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Where is it?
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
...isn't it perfect!
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
Hi.
How you doing Buddy?
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
He did?
Businessman?
What's that?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Hello?
Tony and China?
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
These are good.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
What?
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Hello?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
What?  What are you afraid of?
Tell me.  I can help you.
That's not...It's not like that.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
You look a little old for a student.
They're calling me in to work.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
How you holding up?
Well good.  So you're human.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Oh my god.  You bought it.
It's niiice.
Seance.
Telling you...
Someone's there.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Nothing's happening.
Then what was it?
But Claire--
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
I'm a terrible friend.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
Jody he was lying.
It's today?
Claire?
Whatcha reading?
How are you?
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
Did you...
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Norman, you have to look at this!
Oh.
I think so.  Maybe.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
Tonight?
You're not at the center.
You know I am.
We walked all night...
Your wife...
The leaves...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
What's that for?
Mmmuh...
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
Rowan.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
I beg your par---
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
Who the hel1 -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
There is no one here but the dead.
If that were true, I would not be here.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Harder...
They like you ------- kids.
What else did you see- Michael...?
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
I'm serious.  You don't -
Hello...?
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Wanna snack...?
Hey - you're bleeding.
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Wow...
You okay...?
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
He's got great hands.
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
Which do you think is her best shot...
And it can't be forged?
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
You've killed but you're not a killer
Yes...
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Someday, I'll find out.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
I thought I loved her.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Never say never.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
And I was wondering.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
If you could just sign right there.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
He's on the move?
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
That's part of growing up, honey.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Well? Surprised?
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I'm warning you.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You do like girls, don't you?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
I do?
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
You were the new and improved you.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
What are you doing?
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
How soon can we get something?
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
You mean he withdrew...
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Maybe she used another name.
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Guess I kind of lost it there.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
If you want company...
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
Thank you, Jimmy.
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
You are.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Kelly.  What is it?
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
How much?
We have to stick with the plan.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
I'm here.
Hello?
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Good thinking.
I just want my life back...
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Who is it?
No.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Yes.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
You mean this thing?
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
What?
J. S. Bach.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
You feeling all right?
Now, what was that?
All that jumping and kicking.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
At least I tried something.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Thank you.
When we find him, he is mine.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
My hat is off to you, sir.
God in heaven, what is that?!
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
She's perfectly safe.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Your private train, sir.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
The first.
Dr. Pemberton?
Now it's a bomb.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
They look like acorns.
Why did you say that?
We're a tiny version of all that?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
You all right?
Smells like a battle.
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
I'll help you...!
Did she ask about me?
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Dada, what's a daikini?
What do you want!
You must learn magic.
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
I'm not going in there.
Get back here, Rool!
Madmartigan.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
I'm getting her out of there!
This is not going well.
Talk!  Say something!
Nail it!
He was... like him.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Are they going to kill you?
Have you got your gun on now?
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Just us.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
It's all over, Paul.
You have no right to keep us here.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Whacking?
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
They kid a lot.
But not a good tired.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
But why?
How long have I been here?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Tell him his tea stinks.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
Sure.
Won him over just like that.
I got there late, John.
You know where he is.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
God, Fred...
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
He'll live.
Momma... are they angry with us.
I don't want to stay here.
No --
Dorothy!
Yes.
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Toto's my dog.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Oh, now?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
That's right.  What's she doing?
...bed.
Oh -- 
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Oh --
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh --
And bears!
And him a brain.
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
I'll be home in time for supper!
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
...don't talk.
...yes.
I don't blame you for that.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
...along.
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh -- Oh --
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Oh, you did it yourself!
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Yes, you.
That's right.
I haven't slept in weeks.
It's a whatzis.
Where do we go now?
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
...Tin Man!
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Let's.
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Oh, dear, dear.
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
No, you don't.
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well --
You new?
What happened to Len Tashka?
Who’s she?
The King pipeline.
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
...yes?...
It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
How long has he been with you?
Does this look familiar to you?
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
I can’t stay.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I’m a coward.
What the hell are you doing here?
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
...what?
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
I could have given you the world.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Valentin Zukovsky.
You, of course. I need some information.
Now...where were we?
Where’s the sub going?!
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
What?
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Walter --
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
A whore fucking.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Jon --
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
No.  I just wanted you to --
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
Damn straight.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
Old?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
What the hell -- ?
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
What new information?
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
What happened?
What caused it?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
Their real names, please.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
New information.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Why is that?
Is that all?
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
Yorgi and Kirill.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
I can see that. Why?
Nice hops.
Sorry, "dude".
What's so damn funny?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Scott.. I -
Are you all right?
Anything else I can get you?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
You should always work with a spotter.
Let go.
He's uptight.
He takes himself seriously.
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
The intention of registration act -
I do love a good check mate.
Who?
You designed this yourself?
He helped you?
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
Is it enough?
I'll find him.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Frederick Frankenstein?
Yes, sir.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
What in God's name are you doing?
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Miss me?
You have your tickets?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Will you miss me?
Darling!
Surprised?
Darling!?!
What a strange fellow.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
Well... we'll see.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
I didn't do that.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
But what you were doing?
Did you hear that strange music?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
I want that brain.
Throw the second switch!
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Original.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
Where is he?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
I'm a failure.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Inga!
Inga, wake up!
Ooh!
A god?
All right -- give it to him!
Did you do it?
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
What?
Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Yes, I know.
Are you ready for me?
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Yes, sir, name, please?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
