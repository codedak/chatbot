Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Forget it.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
I believe we share an art instructor
You always been this selfish?
No...
What crap?
What good stuff?
I did.
Expensive?
Hopefully.
Hi, Joey.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Like you care.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I guess I'll never know, will I?
You set me up.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
It's just you.
Perm?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
How many people go here?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
That's what I just said
It's off. The whole thing.
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
You just said
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
Fine, thirty.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
We're not.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
And why would I do that?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Sure, I do
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Who?
BIANCA
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Acting the way we do.
For. . . ?
Fallacy.
Go to the prom with me
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
Enough!
I thought you were punishing me.
Because you're making decisions for me.
So what I want doesn't matter?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
No, Daddy.
Parts of it.
Just smack her now.
Hi.
I'm likin' you guys better
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
Tumescent!
Dr. Ruth?
Your daughters went to the prom.
We'll all go crazy...
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
I find that hard to believe.
I don't want you to wait for me.
Yes... I remember...
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
There'll be a time.
This time with me!
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
... for a commoner?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Look out of that window.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Colon!  Don't!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
You are bound by an oath, Father.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
What did they say about Granada before today?
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
Twenty eight.
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
They're not gonna send you right back.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Right.
Pouring it out!
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Go on.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
End my career?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Yeah.
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Of course.
Just a shower?
Then do it, asshole.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Hey.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Well, that's great.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
That's unique.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Where is escort service?
Is there a problem?
Yes.  Both.
I want to document my trip to America.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Sit down!
Shut up.  Look!
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Did you hurt her?
Milos.  Get my money!
Ha. Ha.
A job?
As a plumber?!
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
I want to hear everything he said.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
What are you coming here to do?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
No way!  He's mine!
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
I used an accelerant.
Oh yeah, why?
How long they been livin' here?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Okay, come on down.
It's possible.
That seems very unlikely.
I guess it isn't.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Yes.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Yes, it is, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
In three days, darling, I hope.
Thank you, Daddy.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Well, where are all of you off to?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
I will if I can, Frank.
Thank you very much, Hal.
Opening pod bay doors.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Here's hoping, baby...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
I got a lot to protect.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
What are you talkin' about?
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
You stay with me...
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Jack?
I lost them, that's what happened.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Yeah.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
You sure you want me to?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
What do you want?
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Not bad, not bad.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
Napoleon... small.
You know exactly where they are!
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
No thank you.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
I brought the girl remember?
So you do know her.
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
I didn't know your size.
Perfect.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Who?
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
How do I look?
In your dreams! See you tonight!
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Have you pulled yourself together?
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Got it...
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Apipoussan!
You know women normally change five times more than men.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I told you not to read all that crap!
...The rain falls...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Uh..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Wonderful!
An elephant couldn't crack it.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Sir!
Got it.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
I love you.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Don't...
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Dino...
Hmm.
And they are?
We can do that.
What are you... ?
I know what you did.
Fuck you!
I told you, I don't know.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Yeah.
Show me.
Show me where you buried her.
Don't think I won't.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Of what sort?
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Shut up.
I'll risk it.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Three, four years.
Max.
Sounds good, pops.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
Specialty product.
See ya.
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Nope.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
Okay, I follow you so far...
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Will you let me look?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
What?
I can't find him.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
That obvious, huh?
You're his sister, right?
Three days.
Is there something we can do?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Then what else can we do?
Let me talk to you.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
About Freddy?
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Don't worry, honey
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
How did you know that?
She doesn't want me around
He's inside you, where he hides.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Alice...
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
Had kind of a long night.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
Krueger is reality.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
So did Dan.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Well we gotta do something!
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Nobody thinks that.
My baby!
That's their problem.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
He invited me to his house last night.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
'Us?'
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
Radiation level...constantly rising...
What about time...?
Under <u>water</u>?
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Who with?
That's what I said!
What?
Minus three.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Toward the Pole!
All right - go to it.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
I hear Twombley got shot.
You can't buy Wade off.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Yeah?
Sun's gettin high.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Piece of fucking cake.
He sure as hell won't.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Do what?
I guess they're stupid.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
To us it was.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
It's stupid.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
No.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Yes.
No.
Nothing.
I know.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You mean Twombley?
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
I'm fine, fine.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Maybe.
Could be.
Yeah, lots.
Mel Gordon.
Okay. She's fine.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
It's nice.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
Think they're alright?
How?
Wade.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
Can --?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
His office. You mean my old office.
Atta-go.
In the living room.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Everything you know is from me.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Wade?
Huh?
How was she?
What happened?
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
No thanks. I don't drink.
What about her?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
That it wasn't an accident.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
A hunting accident is perfect.
Alice...
Jim... for godsake!
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Stay cool.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Where are we now?
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Copy, Air Force One.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
A dubious distinction, no?
Thank you.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
That was war.
Hold on, Alice.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
Please... don't start with me.
Flying the plane.
This is the President.
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
That's my job.
Yes, sir.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
I just wish it was that simple.
I was reading too.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Sir?
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Compute!
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Yes, sir.
That's okay, ROK.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Sure.
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Yes.
Then Elaine was right.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
No. I'm all alone.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
I can't tell.
Well...not for another two hours.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Well...
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I love you, Elaine.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Uh-huh.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Yes, Captain?
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
The cockpit? What is it?
Would you go up, please?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
Lay off, asshole.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Here?
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Yes.
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Nothing.
And that fits?
How the hell do you know that?
Did you learn anything?
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
To the... to the beach?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Thank you.
Nothing.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
What is it?
No... two.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
The human?
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Talk to me, Hudson.
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
They're but off!  Do something!
Sir?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Alive?
You tell me.  I only work here.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Do it!
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
About seventeen days.
On my way.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
No.. I've slept enough.
They're dead.
And hope to die?
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did one of those things grow inside her?
You mean dead.
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
His Grace is very angry with you.
In a harem.
A brothel.
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
Sir -
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I want to go back to Vienna.
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Em iram! Em iram!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
You borrowed money from your mother?
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Stanzi!
I'm not telling you.
You'd think I was mad.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
I can't write it!
It's killing me.
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Yes.
Leave him alone!
Oh, yes.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Hey!
Ah, now! Here she comes.
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
Ah-ha!
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Yes?
Well. There it is.
Really?
Yes?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
What? On one hearing only?
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Thank you, Sire!
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
He's here.
That's not what I hear.
Yes.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Really?
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
What work?
What dead? Who is dead?
Who are you?
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
Are you neglecting my request?
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
This is only a vaudeville.
I'm too young to be so sick.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Oh, yes.
We ended in F Major?
What time?
Yes!
You go fast!
Yes.
Exactly.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Baron!
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
In the sight of God that is a sin.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Here in Vienna.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
I did.
What difference does that make?
Well done, Sire!
Who is she?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Of course.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Yes, sir.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
What did he say?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
I beg your pardon?
What?
Yes?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Will you give me a break?
That's not really a very proper question.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Will you think about it?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
A werewolf?
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Okay.
A doper werewolf.
See you later.
What?
David, let's go now.
No.
No.
Chart says he's from New York.
Why on earth do you say that?
You did, did you?
You could have told them!
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
I assume full responsibility.
You ask them.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Yeah?
It's circling us.
No.
Yeah.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
What do you think?
I want you to meet some people.
How shall I do it?
No.
You here again? What do you want?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Yes - sure—
Yeah.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Yeah.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Yes, sir.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Take it easy, Clark.
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
That's very simple. I was home.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Why not?
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
I want to be near you!
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
My apartment.
Good for you. Come on.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
I'm listening.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Where is he now?
Numbers? No, never mind.
Yes?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
No, sir.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
Yes, sir.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
Yes.
Then where were you?
I guess so.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
What?
Leave me alone, Bob.
What have you done?
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Nope.
Oh no...
Tomorrow.
Exactly.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
What?
I think I recognize you.
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
You're not scared, are you?
Sorry.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Pass me some whisky.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Ho-yah!
You're right, sir.
What is it?
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
I reckoned.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Maybe, maybe...
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Yeah.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Boys?
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Mmmm.
Sparkling rocks?
Me neither.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
I'll explain on the way.
I think so.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Lyla Devereux.
That is so gentlemanly of you.
They had to be dealt with!
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
Can you put men at all four?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pumpkin?
Yes.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
What do you want, Courtney?
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Alright.
Evelyn?
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
I have to return some videotapes.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
I know her. I knew her.
No, he doesn't.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Lucky, I guess.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
What?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Leaving what?
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
When?
Negative. Cancel it.
Can you bring Mr...
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Yes, Patrick?
Oh no. I have no plans.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
What's that?
What are I doing?
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Next Saturday?
Does he do this all the time?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
No. I'm okay.
No, really. I'm okay.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Well, maybe he did, huh?
Oh.
No.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Don.
Let's see...  That you were with-
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
But Marcus denied it?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
I'm not...
I'm hungry.
Al.
It's...it's...all right.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
"Make" him?
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
I can paint anywhere.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Didn't you visit the campus?
We're not gonna let it.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
...Whaddo I do?
I remember.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
I do!
Maybe I'm going too fast.
You're making me young again.
What're you implying.
I'm sure.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Talk about work? Never!
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
The wrong place?
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
...Worse?
'Sorry about the late notice...
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Let's go.
Just do it.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Oh yeah?
Hmm?
No, no. Never.
What about "60 Minutes."
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Wait a second. He knows I know.
Oh we're not going to the campus.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Speaking of which...
Where is he?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Is it about my teeth?
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Hey, how are you?
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Smashing!
Oh, and Austin...
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Oh, and Austin...
What's the other?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Thanks.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Why?
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I am not.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Yes.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Are you crazy?
Lay it on me.
Behave!
Sure.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Silence!
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Yes.
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
I don't want to.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Love...
... preserve...
You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
Eh? In here!
We have met ...
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
But -- why?
Ring?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Rules are made to be broken.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Yes indeed. I need protection.
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Did he say who?
You mean my other self ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Nothing personal.
Always.  Except ...
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Not for a moment.
You don't trust me?
No idea who. No idea why ...
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
What kept you?
I see.
... and now?
I shall need a small plane.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
She may try to kill you.
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
I feel sure of it.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
Walk over to the window ...
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
Did I? My mistake.
Ugh ...
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
When do the girls get to the party?
I'm marrying Debbie.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
I'm very happy for you two.
The car for Debbie?
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
So does Debbie.
She's mine!
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Sure have...
Yes, sir, I am.
I've tried to change her mind.
Keep me informed.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
I can't sleep.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Quiet, Mother.
I hope those guys are all right.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Yes.
I want women.
I'll take some.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah, I guess so.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
You can tell a man by his friends.
The phone made me do it!
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Olivier's in that, right?
The best table in the house.
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Oooooo.
Take care.
I'm saved. Let's party!
My Debbie?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
No.  I need a drink.
It's comin' along... want a beer?
What, you've never seen one before?
Hey.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
I know.
Jennifer.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
Hey, do I know you?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Glass?
And the putty around the door?
But the right guess on this is arson.
What?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
No.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
No need to be modest, Brian.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Engine 115, right?
Management were pin heads.
Coffee sucked.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
He's out.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Putty? On both doors?
I know you.
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
Absolutely.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
"Don?"
No Marty, I don't.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Just catch the son of a bitch.
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Who?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
All right. What are you gonna do?
How about 7 1/2?
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
YEAH!
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
You ain't happy about the green light?
What are you talkin' about?
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Manray needs a job.
How much?
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Well do something about it.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Go on.  Good so far.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Exactly!
We think so.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Always keep 'em laughing.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Do you know how you will use him?
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
This is Cheeba.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
Hello.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
A gift.
I thought it was appropiate.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
You sound like the media.
I'll be right over.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
What's a Negro.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
The best defense is offense.
What do you mean?
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
Oh her.
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...no, she didn't...
...too late, maybe around...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
...like grits and butter...
You slept too near where you got in?
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
How be dat?
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
What do you want to know?
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
No, before my time.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
My people love me.
And what?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
I never was more in earnest.
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
And his baggage?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
As you please.
Yes, sir.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
Yes!
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
What is to be done?
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Yes, of course.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Tender Hegenheim.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Who?
Fine.
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
Can anybody hear me!
HEY!
We don't know. West is dead.
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
Okay.
Yeah --
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Would you have believed me?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
How do you know that?
I...
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
Just look. Little pocket.
From up close or far away?
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
What don't you know?
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Stop.
No. I said Dunbar.
Well?
Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
Well, he's a good soldier.
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
I'm not even going to dignify that --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
I plan to grow on you.
What point?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
Watch me.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
Get in.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Poor fucker my ass...
Wrong answer --
What the fuck are you doing?
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Bullshit --
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
No --
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
Sir, yes, sir!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Edward Bloom.
Yes.
Not yet.
It truly is.
No one's ever left.
I don't expect to.
Fine, I will.
Don.
Eighteen.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
I know.
Lucky girl.
That's terrible.
Stop.
Please?
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
Really?
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Am I?
So how does it happen?
Okay.
Yes.
I think someone hasn't.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
Like this.
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
You say...
Yes. Exactly.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
There is no softer ground than town.
Really.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
I need to lie down for a bit.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You're not.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes. But that's a different...
What for?
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
What do you mean?
Leave him!
Right.
He says he feels safe here.
Oh.  We are Russian.
Good. 
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
No. It is too judgmental.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Syevodnya
Yes I know.
What's wrong?
I know you just want to punish me --
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Have you got your passport?
I don't have any money.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Okay we won't talk about it.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
You didn't mind too much.
You don't understand you either.
Get out.
You don't have to say anything
Please, there's no... Oh.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I'm trying to quit.
It's not mine either.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Just wanted to see.
Yes, ma'am.
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Yeah.
You been home yet?
Better'n me?
LAZ, I said let...!
You sayin' you'll do what?
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
How long... how long I been out?
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Why you got me chained?
In my house, you watch that lip...
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Uh-uh.
Itches.
I can handle that.
Sure.
No joke.
I ain't in a hurry.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
Looks like you know a song.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
Like I told you.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Or what?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
One thing at a time, Laz.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Why she got a chain on her?
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
You could put it that way.
Yeah, I know.
Holy shit!
Ronnie. Please, baby...
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Let go...
Get rid of it.
What?
Saving your life.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
I hope not.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
I wasn't expecting you.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
Good.  Very good...
I want to yank Kobo.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
No.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
I couldn't tell.
I don't know.
A wife.  She left.
Yes...
You met her.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
Save it, I already took the tour.
Not in that company.
Yeah.
Look.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
I'll pay you.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
You certainly have a nice place here.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Where?
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
When do you deliver your project?
Tomorrow, he says.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Soon as I finish the job.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Sorry, don't have the time.
No thanks.
I like you too.
I don't know.
Nope.
Yes?
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
I don't know nothing about it.
Does it eat?
I bet I would.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Ugh.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
I work alone.
Dead.
Not too good.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Go ahead.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
What desert?
Of course.
I never seen a turtle.
Just better.
What's that?
You're all so perfect.
Yes?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
For how long?
Yes, ma'am.
Young man, stop right there!
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Oh, brother...
I just had a mental picture of...
Yes, I'm right?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
What is it?!
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
No.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Doing what?
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
Why?!
Of course.
Is this your house?
Um-hum.
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Well...yeah. Okay.
Look unimpressed.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
Eve, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Yes, Eve?
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Yes, sir.
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Then why go there?
Blow out the candles!
Shit is a French word?
Yes, father?! Yes?
I promise. Is that all?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
And it's called...?
Yeah.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
I'm not wearing his pants.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Goodbye.
Thirty-five.
The sky!!!
Up there!!
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Oh, you got a problem with that?
I'll go up.
I just hope this is still good up there.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
To you maybe.
The locks.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
To go up.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
What?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
--and we will--
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Oh, yes.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
No.
He's from Alaska.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
He didn't leave with them.
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Fallout shelter.
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I'm not sick.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
You did? A human ear?
Yes.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
No. Come on.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I, I don't know.
No, please. I won't.
What?
You don't?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
I, uh.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Frank would open you.
Sometimes I think I do.
Just get outta my bed.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Don? Where is he?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
My bourbon.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Those are my breasts.
If you want to.
Speak to me Fucker.
Go where?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Do you want the car?
Alright.
That sounds great!
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Yes.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Maybe so.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I don't know. He moved away.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
Two.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
Are you sure?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
You better not, Jeffrey.
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Yes mother.
Aye.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Where's your gun?
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
BLAME...
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Be careful.
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
Right.
Aye.
How many?
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
No pictures, either.
...so that which is good may flourish
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
Yes, we are.
A-fuckin'-men!
He's a good man.
How do you figure?
Where's my cat?
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Shit! Shit!
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
You sure you killed them?
Well, what'ya do?
Y-Yes my son.
You feel?
Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
God have mercy on my soul.
What do you want me to say?
How long since your last confession, my son?
Right. The blond guy.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
What do you think the cops have?
Eight dollars.
You think we're going to be chased?
Where's the other stocker?
We know there's another stocker.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
What do you think?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Because my mom gets the bill.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
Bob?
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Hi.
What. What's the matter?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
No kidding.
Bob?
Maybe he just went to the store.
We said 48 hours.
You were asleep.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
What?
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Don't panic, Anthony.
She needed it.
Ah. Couple days ago.
Who's Mr. Henry?
He seems pretty good.
Get out of the way.
Eleven fifteen.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Any activity?
Good. It's supposed to be.
I'll see you there.
I'll get him.
What do you mean?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How?
Scale the --
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
No. Bob did.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
See you, Bob.
There's a million places to hide around here.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Sure.
No.
Cuba.
Uh-uh.
What do you mean?
Is that Buckethead?
Wait a second.
What's he doing here?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
It's true, Dignan.
I told you he's crazy.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Maybe she turned.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
His name was Swifty?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I don't know.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
I'm going back.
What's his name?
Not bad.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
That's OK.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Stand by. Bird Dog?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
We're just going over a few things.
Can't get it. It won't... 
Well, I left some money in there.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Sure.
She is a good looking woman.
You Hoto?
And the Landy woman?
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
Did he say anything to you?
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Thanks.
The sooner the better.
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
I speak English.
Then what?
I can't let you do that either.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Is this really happening?
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
Conklin.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know who that is.
No. There's nothing new.
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
There must be another way!
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Yes.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
What is this, a game?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
What do you mean?
You never worked Berlin...
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Careful...
Sounds like a threat.
I'm working on it.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
You mean, did I want a date?
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
I don't want to leave.
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We must sue for peace.
We cannot defeat this --
He was a modest man.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
Armed?
Aye, we'll get 'em.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
I could crush you like a roach.
No. He did not.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
It matters not, he is thy king!
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
Nor I!
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
And I with you. But you must wake.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
It does me good to see you.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
They've tricked us.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
How soon?...
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Um... can dad come this time?
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Sure...
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Weirder than this?
My journals! Where are they?
But I... I need those books.
Photos?
What the fuck are you doing?
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I'm sorry.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Of course.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
What do you want to know, Evan?
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
So it didn't feel... weird?
Go on. Sit down.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
What do you mean?
Different? How?
Yeah?
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
Know what?
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Y... yes. I guess I did.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Huh?
Oh my God oh my God...
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Well?
I'm sorry. It is.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Yes, sir.
Er, good luck, yes.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
It's not for sale at any price.
Suppose we do.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
Occupied France?
And the other alternative?
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
And I was wondering.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
All except one. He won't have you.
Because you're getting on that plane.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Be careful.
Goodnight.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Apparently he has the letters.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
-- Yes?
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
What for?
Not at all.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
My office.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Thank you.
Yes, rather.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
We'll be there.
Thank you.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
How about New York?
Perhaps.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Okay.
Why two?
-- Thanks. I will.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Yeah? Why?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
Oh, thanks.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Put it down!
Yeah, boss?
Uh, my watch stopped.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Take it.
Why do they have to die for me?
No.
As much as anybody.
They're harder to do than they look.
Well, not really, I --
Sure.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Let's take a look.
I thought I did.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Not if you work for FedEx.
He's your cute thing.
You want to.
I know.
I would have done the same thing.
You have any children?
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
I most definitely say I am.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
No.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
It's me.
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
Believe me I know.
No sweat.
Permission granted.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
Better than I can!
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Two.
Really?
Burma!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Okay...
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
"King Kong". It's really good.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
They wanted a girl.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
She looks after other people's children.
Someone not from Maine.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
Actually, I volunteered.
Migrants?
Okay...
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Yes, for both.
Nobody's named this one yet.
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
Right.
It's just my heart.
So what?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Tough day?
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
Just the last three weeks.
And these cops? What do they get?
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
Mob?
So what? We hide, right?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
You sure?
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Eight A.M. flight.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
I have a good crew.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
No. Just confidence.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
You get an equal cut.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
What?
Why?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Don't ruin this for me.
WHAT?
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
What do we need another Shill for?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
What?
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Where the hell is she?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
A little bit of both.
I can handle it.
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
A Fed? Is he close?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
We're here.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
That's it?
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
Jack Manfred.
Goodnight.
You called the casino a cesspit.
I despise the job.
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
You mean I won't resist them.
I. sold the car.
I've got a job.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
Probably.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
It's the truth.
There was a message, wasn't there?
It's not that.
Don't let yourself down.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
So why did you come to my casino?
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
It won't.
Wait a minute...
What for?
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Jack! It's Jani.
Who did it? Tell me!
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
We check every four days.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
I don't gamble.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Yes.
Fine.
I can see.
I think he's talking to it.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Doolittle, are you there?
Time to start talking.
Well, there's the possibility of...
-- open quantum latches --
Armed.
Thanks.
No.
Of course.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Hmmm...
...nine seconds...
Mafhkin oble groop...
Doolittle...
Any planets?
Ah, negative drop.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Ah... pity, pity...
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Well, what you might try is --
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Phenomenology...
Bruno's girlfriend.
How I make my living, what's your point?
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
That's not why we're here.
What're you talkin' about?
What the hell are you doing?
What?  Where're we going?
No time.
Don't look down.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
A grand.
I got overhead...
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Hello...
First time I ever heard that.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
The one you're wearing?
Too early to tell.
Lauren's not my wife.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
Bent?
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
You did.
Then what?
Nothing on Hannah?
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
You and me both.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
You know what I'm saying.
And because he's my friend.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
You get it when I get her.
You're the best, Maxie.
Later.
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
Max--
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
You don't.
Easy Sketchy.
Say the words, "I understand."
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
Gin.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Got any KISS?
Thanks.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
What? That's disgusting!
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Oh, yeah...?
Check.
I said, I'm sorry!
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
We won?!
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
Neither do I!
Yeah.
Good MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
Like a spear.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
I didn't say shit.
What did you say?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
I am so sorry.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Hey...
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
And you'd never been there before?
Yeah?
Why?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
Who?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Maybe she's asleep.
Infant Memory Generators.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey. You OK?
But you're OK?
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
That is a terrible nickname.
Do they know yet?
Grandma Death.
Why should we care?
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
Frank.
I don't own a television.
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
You've done it again?
If God exists?
God exists because you're horny.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Soon. Time is almost up.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
Come again?
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Yep.
I guess they made him do it.
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Go back to China, bitch!
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Yeah, you betcha...
Loretta, never have kids.
Airport Ho-Jo!
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
We was robbed.
We all do. Now let's go.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Bitch!
Yeah...
Hi.
Then it must be Wednesday.
Hi.
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
Shut it up, Loretta.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
That's right.
Yeah.
Ohio...
Tammy Curry?
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Gladys! Stop it!
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
"Proud... to be... an... American."
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
The king can do to wrong! 
"My"...
"My dear President"...
Yes, sir. 
What's the matter with you?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
He only weighs ten ounces --
Did you shoot the rapids?
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Then you don't wanna work hard?
She did.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
That's not bad for any day.
I can't do it...
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
You swine!
You worm!
No... it was a seven letter word.
I still like UPSTART the best.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
I thought everything was working out fine.
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Yes please, two.
Oh?
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
I'll join you shortly.
Do you?
And here are my mother and father.
Hmmm?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
What do you mean?
I intend to.
Everything will be seen to.
You don't own this man!
Good morning, sir.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
And what was that, John?
I don't understand.
Yes, I think I can.
I am very pleased to meet you.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Yes.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
The main spire.
Yyyess.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
My name is...
Righteousness...
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
How is your tea, John?
Not at all, John.
Oh yes.
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Yes. John wants it.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
You're losing your temper!
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
What are what?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
And the week before that?
But, Erik...
I'll bring it back.
What d'you mean?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
About raping me?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Aaagh! Rape!
Why... should YOU care?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
Very deep... usually...
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
What's it all about?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
That's my boy!
Well, you ARE!
Sorry!
Why should WE care?
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Now stop it!
Like fish.
To the oars!
What is it?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
You will wait?
The Dragon...
What do we have to do?
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
What are you talking about?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
That's right.
Help!
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
Stop it!
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Helpless...
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I told you that later.
No one.
You did? You liked me?
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Well, anyway... Sorry.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
What?
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
No, I'm okay for now.
Yeah?
I don't know.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Yes.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
I want to have a baby.
Yeah, Tangerine?
What do you mean?
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
What?
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Okay.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I think we should go.
I don't know.
Says you were a bully...
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
It's too late.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Sorry. I just --
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Then why did you ask me?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
It's no big deal.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
That's fine, Stan.
Just wanted to let you know.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
It's a quote book.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
I know who you are.
Save your breath for the climb.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Easy come, easy go.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Bonanza Jellybean?
Your ranch?
A job for me?
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
On my way.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
No, he didn't.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
"Another man?" Who?
Hear what?
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
Thank you.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
Start the countdown.
Justin.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
What you got, Peters?
Skipper...
...you okay?
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
The Core...!
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
What makes you think I'll miss?
Better if I just show you.
Starck... Cooper...
Locked and cocked.
Starck, give me a read.
Let's go.
Radiation interference?
Keep your eyes open.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Blow it up?
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
We're losing atmosphere...
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Range 3000 meters and closing.
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
I can't believe we built this.
Yes.
I'm alright. Please.
Relax, it's casual.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
And you can? Power it up?
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
He's made a few changes.
Victor's better at these things.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Got it, teach.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Ben! Ben!
You've been working out.
Oh, it is.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
But all these people...
Please tell me you go silent too.
Never better.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
Excuse me?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
What in the world would give me that idea?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
I gave him twenty.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Raising the shields.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Don't worry about it.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
It's the first door on your left!
First door on your left!
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
Sis.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
They're not home yet.
I didn't say that.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Ugh.
Oh, really?
So are you.  Are you shaking?
You first.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
No.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Really?
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
Yeah?
I'm really pretty busy...
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
So what makes you so sensitive?
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Yes.
And they don't call my parents?
Fascinating.
Totally.
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
I thought he was out of town.
Naw. Any good?
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
No.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Yeah, like maybe never.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
What class?
Really?
Yes.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
All right! Oh, yeah!
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
Yes.
Sure thing.
Oh yeah.
Not at all.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Do you really have to go?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Two Cokes.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Crying? Why was she crying?
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
Not where we operate.
Naked.
WHAT?
Dobermans don't talk.
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
A major!
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
This is my granddaughter...
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
GO?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Me?
It's gone too far.
Yes!
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
I fear nothing.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
You and a lot of other people.
We're going to get my little girl.
Yeah.
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
Who the hell would you call?
C'mon guys--
And the rest of 'em?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Hey!
Easy.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
No. You?
Just an observation.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
He's dead.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
What's in the back?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
How much I got, what?
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Covered.
Holds four.
Seven.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
What?
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
HELLLPPP!
That's fine.
Whoa!
That's one piece of four problems.
Stop her!
Let's lock off this room.
All right.
Deal.
I'd love to.
I'd like nothing better.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Thank you.
Huh.
Who is she?
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
An actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
Right now we have to be practical.
In my eyes, officer.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Claire?
Fired?
...Yes.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
I gotta go now.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Thank you.
I know.
And you think it's worth all this?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Good.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
You can always come see it in London.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Why, you... you little bastard!
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Not me. But other people seem to.
Yeah, well --
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Enh.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
...So you think I should go.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Yeah.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Forget it.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Frances...
No, Harry, I can't -- 
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
Who?
I love you too, Frances.
Just a little way.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
What'd you do?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Fine!
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Mama, what's...
Go on...
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
But what -- 
Excuse me.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Stay calm, please.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
Sedate her.
No! No!
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
You speak.
Kill me and have done with it.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
I don't know.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
She's not for you.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
Quite right!
It's been months. It's not like him.
So have I
Fine.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
And you?
I wish to be your husband.
Only you.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
As a march hare.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
I've been preoccupied.
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
Is that your diagnosis?
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
No. They don't.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Despite the lack of challenge.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
I'm... dying.
No, no, they're all dead...
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
I was careless.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Sure.
You're right. It makes no sense.
I don't know.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Okay.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Somebody'll see.
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where'd you get that stuff?
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Where's Ned?
Dancer.
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
That was the telephone.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Lead the way!
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Those things can be nasty.
One night on the town.
That's thirty percent.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
I'm exhausted.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
Thank you, son.
Yes, she is.
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Pass.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
Kate, Scott?
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Scott?
Yes.
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
-- you got your shower --
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Whatsamatter?
Knock yourself out.
Six-fifty.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
No.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
What?
What?
What?
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
Really?
Where are you right now?
It don't look together.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Thank you, ensign.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Didn't take long.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
Entering my scan now...
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Sounds familiar.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
I'm sure it is.
No, ma'am.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
I can make this wall without --
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
This has nothing to do with you.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Which is guy-speak for...
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
What?
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
You got anybody, Wick?
Sure, sure.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
I don't know...
Mighta been civilian.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
Show us where you are, Chief.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Who is he?
What's it to you?
What do I get?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
So have dinner with me tonight.
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
Oh, I'm not married.
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
Get your people out of there or I will.
It's Tatopoulos.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
You're standing on it.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Sure.
How do I do that?
Just don't.
Thanks.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
I won't and nothing you say-
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Why didn't you stop at the market?
All this from watching the.. historical records?
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
Excuse me guys.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
It's okay. Listen-
We'd never have the budget for this.
Yes Commander?
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
We're getting major structural damage.
Yes?
The enemy is matching velocity.
All systems are working, Commander.
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
You... know us?
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
All right. Put me back on with him.
Yeah, what is it?
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Jason..
JASON...
Computer, can it be repaired?
Why does this sound so familiar?
Turn on the translation circuit.
What the hell are you talking about?
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Because it was on the show!
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
You have ten seconds.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
I think we're going to exit the space port.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Oh god...
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
And a French alliance?
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
It is.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
I?  You all know my history.
Same old story.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
That you would have known you can trust me.
No, my lord.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
Lafayette will not be happy...
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
No one knows...
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Lafayette is a child!
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
Detained by what?
We already have black soldiers in our army...
George!  So good to be back!
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
They help me understand why we fight.
I... they look both the same.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
It is; we need you George.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
I think I will disappoint you.
Let's get you darker!
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
Juba was a Numidian.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Farrah. Come here.
Calm down, Bear...
I have to ask you for that key.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
Harry, let me answer that.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
I'll find it.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
That's the magic number.
What three hundred grand?
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Yeah? Which terminal?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
Not yet. I just started.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Maybe a few times I have.
Once.
Harry, look at me.
Who's the star?
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
So what's the problem?
His shrink's trainer.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
You have it?
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Personally?
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
Like this?
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
They report it to the IRS.
Who told you that?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
...That's what we finally decided.
For any movie.
Man, can you scream.
"Cotton".
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Not yet.
There a part in it for you?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
Depends, who pays?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
You're as bad as Harry...
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
Don't say a fuckin' word.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Be quiet and listen.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Thanks.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
With that coxswain dickhead.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
So we kill him?
Maybe he isn't alone.
Oh yeah.
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Why not?
What?
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
How long to fix?
Hard to say.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
Could be meant as a warning.
So whoever did this might still be around.
What is it?
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Conveniently enough for you.
If money can buy what he wants.
I bet you did.
Too big. More like a freighter.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
You're a pal.
Better than starving to death.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Nope.
The guy. He just came this way.
There's somebody else on this boat.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
Epps.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
What?
But, who -- ?
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Maybe it was more than that.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Lost my sea legs.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
Better late than never.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I just buzzed him in.
But I can't --
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Uh-oh.
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
But I was only trying to be friendly...
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Can I come in?
I guess.
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Let's go hassle Josh.
Where?
You cunt!
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Go ahead...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
I said "great"...
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
I need to talk to you.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
That's all you're bringing?
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
Well, we won't keep you.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
Norman.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
God, fuck you!
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
Sure, I guess.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Good luck...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
I really didn't get a good look at her.
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Just wait here.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
Does that mean you don't like me?
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
What?
I-I-I...
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
Yes?
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
As are they all.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Am I to take it you want to live?
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Don't they, though?
But overall, you're pleased?
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
Then why do you stay?
Then we agree. 
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Does he speak English?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
But you said they were always old.
I can try.
Has it ever done that before?
But of course yours worked.
What happened to them?
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Thank you, Samuel.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Good night, Janosz.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Certainly.
I'll supervise.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Peter, what about the bathtub?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Now you're talking.
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
Okay.
My pleasure.
I know.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Do I?
Did I forget something?
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Hello, Venkman.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
His nickname is "The Hammer."
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
And we're the ...
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
Something good --
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I'm Peter --
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
And decent.
Wonder what?
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Are you sick, Louis?
Hi, Louis.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
No?  What do I act like?
Well, let's check it out.
I told you, I ...
Are you all right?
I'll scream.
All right.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
I want you inside me.
Really!  Is it gone?
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
I don't believe in luck.
Here are tonight's calls.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
A square?
Two wavy lines?
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
What have you got, Egon?
What?
Why not?
Does she want to be?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
I agree.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
She said he was "the Destructor."
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
God, it's ugly!
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
What?  What popped in there?
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Caesar?
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
I'm serious.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I don't know...
But have never been?
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Why you?
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Why do you play at being drunk?
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
He killed his father and then my family...
So I understand.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
I was summoned.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
I can see that...
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Alive... I'm alive...
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
Hello.
No.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Of course not.
No.
Yes.
You do?
That woman --
Get out of here.
At the Zoo.
I've never been to it.
No.
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
Here he comes.
All right then! Yes!
What?
What did she say?
Because it isn't true.
I don't see how we can.
Shhhh.
Hello -- who is this?
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
What?
Who screamed?
Get out!
Could you bring it up?
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
The Singleman party, sir?
What? No. Nothing.
Oh no.
What?
What?
Right.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Sit down.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Right.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
Yes, I have --
What if he did?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Why is it?
Jesus Christ!
Oh my God.
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
A drink? Of course.
Well -- I don't know.
Benjamin.
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
Is this -- what?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Well?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
I don't.
What one.
What novel did you read.
There!
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
He's asleep.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
What?
Calm down, Benjamin.
No we don't.
Is it?
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
I don't.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Not particularly.
Yes.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Then let's hear them.
Benjamin?
Yes.
I see.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Yes, but I'm afraid --
Sure.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
What else?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Goodnight.
I do.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
We haven't.
What about it?
No.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
Oh no.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Ben -- how old are you now?
That's a hell of a good age to be.
You'll never be young again.
Mr. Robinson?
I'd like to discuss this.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
That what he says. Right?
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
Not now.
Yes.
You might find a bullet through that head...
Have you seen it?
That.
Oh -- work!!
Aren't you?
You're very funny --
Of course.
Yes --
For tonight. 
Because you love me -- you love me?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
You are beautiful!
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
When are you leaving Berlin?
For Vienna?
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
I thought she was splendid!
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Nobody, Doctor.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
Everything?
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Money!
Moreover --
You pay me.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Definitely off.
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Here, hold up!
Why not?
Shhh -- here he is now.
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
I wish to be alone.
But when did he go? How do you know?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
You'll never shit right again.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Roy? He's always crying.
Fine.
Henry, no!
Can't move.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Well, make it stop!
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
I know.
Why? What's wrong?
What is?
Hello.
Roy Dillon.
Lead on.
Just myself.
No?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Only one tooth?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
I guess I owe you my life.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
Bluebell came in?
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
Get off the grift, Roy.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Well, that's good news.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
As though you do what I say.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Not very good!
Never.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
I don't?
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
What?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
Are you sure?
All? It ain't bad.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
Every day in every way.
Because it's comfortable.
I'll sign that affidavit.
And when he got serious?
Yeah? How?
Where?
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
What?
For Christ's sake, why not?
I'm happy the way I am.
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
The cemetery...
Charming.
Care to join me?
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Checking out your place.
You're so predictable.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
John...
Why not?
Then you come out here.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
What?
You're right.  It does sound strange.
Yeah.
What is it?
Can't you hold it?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
He says things.  Bad things.
You can't expect us to stay here --
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Wait a minute ...
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
But surely Rogers isn't --
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
It's a sign.  He's come home.
I'll meet you over there.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
No one.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
At least!
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
So long, Colonel.
First Nagasaki--now this.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Really?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
As a matter of fact--
Where's Mom?
They were in the same creative writing class.
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
England?
Mhravitch.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
No, no, no, no, no.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
The smallest thing I've got.
Make it fast.
Leave a tip.
What's this?
No.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Situation.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Have some.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
Say hello to your mother.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
What a honeymoon.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
Yes.
I don't think so.
Rifle?
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
What a handsome word.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Ooops.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
He's dead, you know.
Hello, Mother.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Would you say that again?
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
What for?
Yes.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Comical?
And terror, if you don't mind.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
You don't know?
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
I heard you were looking for me.
Yes.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
What a relief!
I don't want to live any more.
He's alive!
I was afraid to ask.
I didn't know that.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
Keeps fairies away!
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
Something happens to my confidence.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
You figure!
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
Marry me instead.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
Yes, we do.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
No.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Well, I want to...
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Wait?
Okay.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
What's that shade of blue called?
Sam?
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
I am.
Ulcers.
A friend.
At least I'm a growing person.
What rate?
No.
But it's all you do.
Not very.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Fuck.
No, please go on.
You really believe all that?
On your own land?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
...What do you have to offer?
Mr. Van Dorn?
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
What have you found out?
What do you mean?
No.
Hmm.
Who made it?
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
Just leave me alone.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
That's not true, Mr...?
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
No.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
What?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
You never heard of that?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
You're taking a big chance.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
You working in San Diego now?
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Where are the papers?
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Nice to meet you.
Your hearse?
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Oh, at the dentist's?
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
My door is always open.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
Certainly a new experience for me.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
It's all right.  It's organic.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
What was that?
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Where's that?
Here.
I took them out.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
At a funeral.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Why?
Huh?
Yes.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
Yes, sir.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
You think so, sir?
Another man's life in your sights.
Yes.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Souvenirs?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
I knew you'd come.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Yes!
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
I know.
It certainly is.
What?
So you slept O.K.?
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
What are you talking...
And what about you?
You were ALL human!
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
Yeah.
See what??
Story of my life.
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
I'm lucky that way.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
See? I don't like that --
What is it?
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
From where??!!
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Anung-un-Rama...
I can live with that.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
My job.
Father's back?  Still angry?
My arm is fine. Where are you??
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Good night.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Red, I --
He's just pushy.
A brute.
What -- ?
Oh, sod you.
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Her mother's dead.
Julia's my second wife.
It's just a puzzle box.
No!
Stay the fuck away from me.
One last time. Give me the box.
Poor baby.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
I don't want to see the dress.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
What do you want me to do.
Keep your voice down.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Not know.
You're still afraid.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Maybe.
There's very little I can do about it.
Hi. I got soaked.
Where's Daddy?
I saw everything.
The best part of ten years.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
No. I'm not.
In here.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
I'm going to throw up.
There's a first time for everything.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
That's right.
I prefer the floor.
That's right.
Maybe I will.
Steve.
Call me tomorrow.
Is Julia here?
Surprise.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Really?
Sure.
I don't believe it.
I have to get out.
I AM house-trained.
We walk.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Your father told me you were working here.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Say it.
Well what's the point in that?
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
What do you mean, "what?"
Ehh.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
What the fuck is that?
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
So?  You even said they're good.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
I have all of the others.
They always seemed...
I have a television.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Nice friend.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Do it.  Do it.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
I should be so lucky.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
No.
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Just ask it!
We'll talk some other time.
Have you slept with him yet?
I guess.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
It was kind of funny.
You still together?  Going all right?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
Those aren't mine.
I can't talk right now.
No, no.  When are you going home?
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Uh... No.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
Hi.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
To make you feel better.
Okay.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
Harder.
No use.
Wanna go to dinner?
Not in love, exactly, but...
I don't know.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
It's true!
Well she --
What difference does it make?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
Whiskey.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Right.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
Sixty.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Nice.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
Go to hell.
Fine.
The boy _died_?
Yes.
Basil the II.
Where?
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
You've been listening to rumors.
Not all of them.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Yes.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
You won't.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
It'll never stick.
You're an asshole, Moran.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
What are you doing man?
-Auditorium nostrum-
Your name is Conor?
This is madness!
No!
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Muy Bien!
It's like to kill me first.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
I feel hardly nothing.
But why be so concerned about me?
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Certainly not me.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Finish yours?
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
It can be different.  It must be.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Your father must be smart.
I don't know.
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Kahn?
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Of sorts.
MACLEOD!
This isn't done.  Get up.
It's all we have.
And if I refuse?
Yes.
American.
I presume it's a sword.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Do you?
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
His only kid.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Same.
Hildy!
What's the idea of locking this?
Open this door!
Hello, Bensinger.
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
It doesn't have to rhyme!
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
I lost my wallet.
I'm sure you haven't any.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Oh.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
Gee! Take a look, will you?
Say, I want to be sure, too!
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
Out of the mouths of babes.
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
I notice you still remember it.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
What?!!
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
Just what I said. That's what I --
You -- you --
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Say, could I meet him?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
What for?
Thank you.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
I know. Where is he, I said.
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
Where's Bruce?
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Come here. See if we can move it.
What is it? Here!
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Walter!
Walter, you can't do that!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
You know you did!
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
I'm busy, Duffy.
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Yes, sir.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
What have you got, Hildy?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
I'll have it in a minute.
So long, Hildy.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
Yeah. But I --
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
Throw him out, Frank.
I was just going to!
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
What did you do with her?
I'll go right after it.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Huh?
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Isn't that her picture?
I won't, Earl. 
Put down that gun, Earl.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Never mind! Just play dead.
Forty dollars.
No, I don't think so.
You're insane!
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
What's that?
They're not.
Sod.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Would.
I'm starting my own collection.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
A bit too quick.
I don't know?
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Jam.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
Grace!
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
Father, that's enough now
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Huh... what cone?
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Baby! Stop!
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Oh yeah, the tree.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
You're welcome.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
OK, Boss.
How much further?
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
He won't move.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
What!
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Hmmmmm.
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
I hear ya.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Sleeping.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
You got to be fucking joking.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Enough with the stupid voices.
Sorry.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
Where we headed?
I ain't got a warrant.
Shit... fuck procedure.
That's it?
Right.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Right...  ...come on.
We found one.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
And think about what you've done.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Like father, like son.
Oui, doctor, oui.
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Hmmmph.
No!
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
Please let me go with you.
Okay.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
Ouch. Yeah?
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
What do you mean?
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
Really?
One night stand?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Lila, it's Rosie.
Nathan told my brother.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Oh, Rosie.
Shut up, you.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
Where?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
I'm not sure.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
I like you, too, Nathan.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
That's a great idea.
Yes, darling.
A deer?
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
I have to think! I have to think!
No.
Sure. Of course.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
That was wonderful!
Should I come with?
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Ugnh.
Oook. Oook.
Ooka.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Got it.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
No.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Yes... Derek.
Yep.
Mm hmm.
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
Next game, ten bucks.
You want a chaser?
It's open...  What'll you have?
No, I'm fine.
For whom and for what?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
Thank you.
That's the way it's done.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Cash.
Cut.
Two.
Yeah. Sure, sure.
I got drunk.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Whaddya been so far?
Thanks for the drink.
For who?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How're the hands?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Want some free advice?
You well-heeled, partner?
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Talk to me, Charlie.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Now and then. Why, do you?
Okay, friend.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
What bus?
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Then why go to the bus station?
I'm not.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
No.
Give me a drag.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Thanks.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
What's this supposed to mean?
You wanna drink?
Why did he tell you?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Yes, I'm glad.
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Come here. Come on, now.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Game's over, Eddie.
My wife.
Yes.
We don't know that --
Have you looked inside?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Yes.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
Do we have to?
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
What did it look like?
I left it at work.
Good night.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
All their lines were busy.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
You have to leave the White House.
Connie, don't hang up.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
More than likely.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
Three years.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
They don't know this.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
I'm making a mess.
I can't shake her free.
You as well.
Then God help us.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
And our troops here?
Then find them.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
What?
Butt-munch.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Butt-munch.
He's my angel.
No. Exotic.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I didn't even see them fire!
It's all fuzzy.
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
Above American soil?
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Deploy.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Peace? No peace.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
That was our assessment as well.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Yes?
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
All I have to do is scream.
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Out!
I came to get you! What do you think?
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Right.
Will you take it easy!
I came here to save you.
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
What?
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
I don't know. We'll find out.
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
"J".
We named the dog Indiana.
Ready.
Come on -- come on!
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
Just a routine inspection tour.
You think so?
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Just a statue.
You don't like him do you?
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
What?
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
Two are still missing.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Oh yeah?
The old man saw it in a dream.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
Their children?
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Somehow I feel safer in here.
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
Just one arm!
It's starting to let go!
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
You're talking to an authority in that area.
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
What -- the bug?
Willie!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
No... the heart's still beating!
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Go!
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
Who's you?
Al ???!!!
I'm...inside you.
It wasn't him.
...I need to make a phone call.
No.
Right.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Kill myself.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Hear voices don't I.
You're gonna explain.
Yeah.
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Why not?
Oh...Gooood!
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Then what are you stopping for?
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
I'll sue.
With Authority!
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Use my credit cards.
Why not?
You are in trouble. Now do it.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
You'll be me.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
What? What do you mean?
What was?
Don't just stand there, say something.
.
No...you idiot!
...Rene...
It is my business. It's my name.
Are you serious?
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
Is that all?
Shit! You're in love.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
That's not funny.
Drink lots of water.
Never mind, just say it.
You were with GRUNER!
Probably.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Aim what?
Looks like you can have all you want.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
It'll remind me of you.
What part what?
Oh, I can't.
Dieter?
I insist.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Surveilliance on them all.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
He's not an ordinary man.
I think I've heard of you.
What?
Oh.
What things?
Remember what?
Here?
The little man in my...  ...head...
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
I didn't say anything.
No. No one to speak of.
Do what?
I just work for the travel firm.
That you're not crazy.
You talk to yourself.
You did.
...Naw. Made that up.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
And you, what do you like?
You seemed interesting.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
No.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Why?
I'm just on vacation.
He must be a good friend.
What is it?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
I can't fly it.
Why?
Why did you, then?
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
What?
I've never met anyone like you.
Why not, what are you going to do?
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Why'd you invite me here?
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Thanks.
Why not?
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Okay.
Instant rice...?
I heard them.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Sure. Where?
Monday.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Maybe later.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
I'm not touching my film...
What caliber is your gun?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Okay. 
No, no, we're fine...
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Did I tell you you were wrong?
No, thank you.
Did you say Berman?
"60 Minutes"?
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
I'm alone on this...
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
...you fucked me!
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Okay. Thank you.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Hardly new news.
What's this?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
Who are these people?
What?
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
Black, black...
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Far as you go where?
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Good. I want to talk to you.
Why am I gonna mention your name?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
It's obvious, isn't it?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I don't think you really understand --
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
I heard.
Yeah, great.
You mean... since this morning?
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
What?
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
What?
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Is that... one person?
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Grounds?
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Thanks, buddy.
It's your move, Miles.
I said yes.
I'll be right back.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
You just haven't met the right person.
He wants a reconciliation.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Howard is a beautiful person.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Me. Yes.
No, we're not!
What is it Miles?
Did you just propose to me?
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Miles.
May I come in?
What do you want?
Meaning my house.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Now. But first, he worked for you.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Marylin?
Marylin.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
You used his credit card.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Oh brother. Here we go.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
I'm not sure.
Video.
Nothing.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
HA!
What...?
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
-- the coin?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Who's Rex's guy?
Muriel Rumsey.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
You were taken for a buggy ride?
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
Do you love her?
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
South America.
I'll get it annulled.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Oh, no.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Is that his name?
Oh, please, Dad—
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads—all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
Yes, of course.
What do they say?
Thanks.
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Beat it! 
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Not at all. 
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
What are you talking about?
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Why, haven't you—?
To New York?
That's silly.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
What?
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
I don't want it now.
Doesn't sound very exciting.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Hitch-hiking.
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
Oh, no!
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Why not? I'm hungry.
Come on—get in.
Darling!
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Yeah, swell.
You bet I did.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
I'm out! I'm out!
Who—me?  Want to see me?
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Do you know?
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Get out!
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Thanks.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Yeah.
Well, I'll be—
Okay, pete. 
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Yeah.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Zeke.  Git!
Yeah. Just babies.
No.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I did not.
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Why Galveston?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
I know.
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
Tough day.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Between six and seven seconds.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
How many men?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
Allen Dulles?
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
...and your General?
Ever ask him?
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
And Oswald?
The assassination, Jack?
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
She's the best damn witness we have!
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
Germany.
Uh huh.
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
I understand.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Arrest me.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Can you do it or not?
Fine.
In cash.
I thought you might want a drink?
Why does it need to be dark?
Great.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
Shit.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
The Delfonics.
'74, I think.
He called you?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Bigger?
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
When did you decide?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
What if I've figured a way?
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
What's he doing?
I didn't say you did.
Spain.
Do you live together?
You planted that shit on me.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
If I'm working, I can help you.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
What are you doing?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
Not in the fitting room.
What about me?
Buy ya a beer?
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Dreaming.
Got some o.j.?
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
I told them.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
I'll give ya ten.
What'd you care?
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
Man, I don't like that part.
Sure.
Two months shy of four years.
Bank robbery.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
It's a diet thing?
The roller disco one.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
We had done time together already.
I don't like dancing.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
Who's arm is that?
That sounds like a problem.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
Does that bother you?
Uh-huh?
All right already.
Then what?
An employee I had to let go.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Twice. In the parking lot.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
What?
Tell me.
You gonna tell me who it was?
How am I supposed to know that?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
Watcha gonna see?
Have fun.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Gonna have to put up cash.
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
House.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
Hear what?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
What does she do for you?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
Uh-huh.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
You expect me to just walk in there?
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
He leave town?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
No, don't. But thanks.
What do you want from me?
Oh, terrific.
Just my luck.
That's right. We did.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
I'm hanging up.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
What else did he say, Jake?
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
I know.
What? By myself?
I haven't seen her in months.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Whataya mean, no record?
Go to sleep.
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
Thanks.
Don't ask.
Jezzie, I can't see.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
A good lay.
Not to me.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
Where?
The numbers stop at 107.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Am I home?
I love you, Jez.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
He did? When?
Why didn't you call me?
Jezzie?
Let go!
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I promise.
I love you when you're angry.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
Mid-town mostly.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Like it was yesterday.
So why tell me now?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
What is it?
Pleasant dreams.
Just relax.
Push 'em back.
Where am I?
I need to see you, Jake.
Count 'em on one hand.
Who is?
Why not?
Died?
How did it happen?
Alright, asshole.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
No.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
Done?
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Thorgan, pull us in.
He came for me, I had to run!
And you said high school was boring.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
What are you doing back?!!
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
My job.
You got that right.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
What if we don't?
And what happend to ...?
She broke my fucking nose!
We're screwed.
I'm on my way.
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
You lost the charge?
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Just get us to the ship!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
So what else is new?
Crutch?
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
You killed him?
Oh shit! There he is!
Am I in there?
Who are you apologizing to?
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
I just know.
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Nanotechnology.
Three...two...one...
Exactly.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
You got it.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
You going to be all right?
Do I need any more authority?
I was only reacting to what I was told.
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
Why?
Maybe we can save August...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Who are you?
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
What stinks so bad?
They must've hit something.
Why don't we just tow it in?
It's a whale out there.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
No...  You think we can get back with those?
Just keep kicking.
I didn't know her.
We never had any. What's the problem?
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Is anyone having this...?
He's busy.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
I think I can top that, Mister...
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
Thanks for the message.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
But you copy my work every week.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Or something.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
What?
No...
Yup.
Yup.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Oh, go fly a kite.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
I'm a junior.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
Hey, I like this.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
That suits you.
Consider it your musical education.
Come on, I have something for you.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
No?
What's the matter?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Really? Fingernails?
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Room with a toilet, got it.
Oh really?
Nothing...
Elbow.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
You mean like couples?
I am a suicide risk.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
That is sick, man.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Or stage parents!
Right, seriously.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Keith's hot.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Yeah, downtown.
It's a loft.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
Karma.
It's a portfolio of my work.
Took 'em all.
...Anything else?
That's not true!
Early, you are so sweet.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
Early, sing me a song.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Early! Stop!!
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Walter Livesy.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Yeah.
...I do.
...just like that?
Thanks. What are you doing?
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Funny, very funny.
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
I'm finished.
Where's Adele?
Shut your mouth.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
...You're hurting me...
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
...That'd be my guess.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
Umm. Altogether?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
You fucked it?
How?
Are you hungry?
The cartoon?
Right.
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Yep.
Bet.
Why I do what?
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
Yeah.
I don't know. How much do you want?
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Is it cold?
You have?
At the block party?
How do you know?
But I'm scared Telly.
Nothing?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
I tested positive?
You're OK?
Everything is wrong.
Thanks.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
I know.
No, I didn't bleed.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
No. I just gotta go find him.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
Yep.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Yeah I get bored.
Yeah.
You've heard the stories right?
Holy shit. That's all true?
But then I won't need your money.
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
Yep.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
It's grandmother style.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
No.
What?
Let's see how much he wants to play.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
Maybe you should.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
No, I need the original note.
Get off me!
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
But a hundred men could move him.
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
The police haven't told you?
You sonofabitch!
I've figured out the message.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Why did he what?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Okay.
Thanks, David.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
About a quarter to one.
We're going to work on the message.
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
Whatever's on your mind.
No.
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
It's alright.
How come you don't stay with them?
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
How can you look at it so clinically?
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
You don't understand.
But I do.
He didn't tell you either.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
I don't have to go through with it either.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
About what?
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
I have no extraordinary powers.
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
But there is another entrance to this place.
You won't have to.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
What do you see?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
I'm not sure.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
You have done it?
Yes.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
I cannot betray my bride.
I have need of friends.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
I'm all right.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
No.
And mine goes with you.
I'd wish for a puppy.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
Fewer will survive them.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
No, she was not as beautiful.
We had no children.
It is no trickery.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Yes.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Huh... 500 meters?
Whoever.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
OK.
Yes, yes...
What?
Yes.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
...17.
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Nothing, for the moment.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Huh, that's good!
Messina.
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
No... Dino's.
No...
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Maybe later.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
Pardon?
You have?
Okay.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
Then why?
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
Show me.
Please tell me.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Good.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Pacifica, California.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
That's all right isn't it?
Jumped where?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Is that right?
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
Yes.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Why know?
So I've been informed.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
I need your help.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Yes.
Evening News?
What are my choices?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
You OK out there?
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Don't be silly?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
No?
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
We?
Be careful.
Yeah... I'd like that.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I am lonely, Yuri.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Go to hell.
I believe you! Don't worry.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Yes.
Tell him, Paulette.
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Yes, I am.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
What?
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
That's terrible!
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
You know her?
You think?
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Power yoga?
What?!
I will...
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
But maybe it is --
No, she can't move for an hour.
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
For a butt-head? Yes.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Of course, I do!
No, silly. I go here.
Harvard. Law school.
Thank you. Having fun?
Thank you.
Yes.
Chuck.
Cunnilingus?
Pull up next to him!
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
Not from me, surely...
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Who might these friends be?
Faerie ring?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Don't you care about what's happened?
There must be an answer somewhere.
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Don't get too far!
Never show mercy!
He'll not escape me.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
They'll do nicely.
Sorry.
Or perchance...
Stop complaining.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
My own father...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
I don't want it on me.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Then, perchance you'll me.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Everywhere!  Ow!
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Ask away, sweet man.
She's dead!
And am I not fair?
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
The Black Baron, you say?
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
I wanna be with you today.
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
Mom said I should.
Here, honey!
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Monday.
What's that?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
It could have been a squirt gun.
If that's what it takes.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Maybe that's too long.
I hate this job.
Uh huh.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
I don't know.
To check up on me?
Why would you be there?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I almost saw Catalina.
I warned you yesterday.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
You'll have money when you work for it.
Hey...hey!
I don't know.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
What I'm not.
Nothing.
He's got nothing to do with me.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
To hide a black eye.
That's so weird...
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
What did you do with your dog?
Why call me?
Money?
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
Well, for later then.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
Sam's favorite.
What have you been before today?
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
I think so.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
What did he say?
So could I.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Not a perfect day.
No.
Does Alyssa know?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
I didn't go in your room.
Yeah.
Yes, it is.
Nigger.
Not for me, it ain't.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
That's because I've never been here before.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Claude Banks.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Oooh...
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
Yeah, I want some pie.
What gave you that idea?
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
I'm stuck!
Let me see that.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
That's the way it is.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
I said you're soft.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Why the hell not?
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Made just for you, Cookie.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
You heard the boss! Let's move!
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
What were they, bootleggers?
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
He must still be in there.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Are you offering me a bribe?
Shoot him, Wilkins!
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Me? Willie Long.
That's a long story...
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
You found him.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
...their damned souls will be ours.
An angel?
It would be so okay.
You're already there...
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
You did it for Namath.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Definitely.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
Coulda been much worse.
It's Stanley, sir.
What was it called, sir.
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Yes, great movie...
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
"Octopus people?"
Sometimes, sure.
Basically, yeah.
I have to, Valerie.
See something you like, my man?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
From? From? From?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Up there.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
Only a few? You're just not trying.
I'm fine...  See you...
It has nothing to do with you.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
I'm Mary 2.
I'm very smart.
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
Please... No.
No.
I changed my mind.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
Six. I go red next year.
All right.
You know something.
It's different now. Help me.
I don't have much time.
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
Of course --
I have.
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Beloved wife...
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
No.
All this. All of it.
At least it's over...
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
I have always been here...
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Alive?
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Yes...
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
They're comin' with us.
Yes, I thought my wife...
What do you mean by that?
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
Yeah... Laurent.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Me, too.
We should stop seeing each other.
I used to.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
Okay.
Why are ya goin' so early?
Yes.
Alice, I...
Alice?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Alice?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Yeah? what did they want?
No.
His physical condition.
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
No, sir, it's not.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
What about yesterday?
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
Pete, what happened to you?
Coming up.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
I... I didn't say anything...
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
No, no. I want to go in.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
But my head...
That's absurd.
Alice who?
Maybe.
What night?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Thanks, guys.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Just a minute.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
What?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Come on.
YOU'RE SORRY!!
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Please don't call me Lovey.
I'm thinking.
Yes.
Just call me Barney.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
I'll say.
Gold. You were going to—
No.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Look, Bob!
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
That's intelligent.
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
Centuries.
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
The only one.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Shall we have another?
Yes, charming.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Oh, I'm so glad.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Then it's done.
Pardon me—
Oh, dear.
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Father Perrault is dead.
Yes.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Do you think this will come in my time?
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
Right, Bob.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
See that spot?
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
That's what you said.
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Yes.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
In for what?
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Yes, I know.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
Struggling, why?
I was just going to.
Why, mother?
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
It's Fenner.
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
Go? Where?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
I gotta be honest about something.
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Kay...
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
So what's the problem?
You don't know the half of it.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
We're rising.
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
For how long?
Do his job.
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Do have any idea what I just said?
Why not?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Actually... I don't know.
Out of focus?
They respond to fear, right?
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
Come on now.  People are smart.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
It's... coming.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Yeah, Kay?
Noon exactly.
Actually, yeah--
Will it lower the curve?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Don't tell me.  Insects.
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
She's still alive?
Yeah --
We know each other?
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
Yes, you did.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
... Graveyard shift.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
I'm fine, Lamar.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Everybody runs.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Yeah?  So?
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
We're in motion on something.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
That was easy.
Yes.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
I need your help.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
That's great.
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Once I even told him I loved him.
Hold your breath, Dad...
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
I'm... not... a... killer.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
And how did Lamar become involved?
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
So you won't help me?
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
You look great.
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
None of your damn business.
What?
Where are you?
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
I think you're swell company, Knott.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
Who?
I forgot my glasses.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
We used to, every summer.
Have you been there recently?
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
What does he want with a precog?
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
What are you talking about?
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
You're Bobby, right?
Is it a good room?
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
What if I gave you forty?
Where's the place to go tonight?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
We're in Fashion.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
She's, uh, sleeping.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
Where were you?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Who's watching the baby?
I'm ready.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
How could you let her see this?
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
5-5-1.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah. Where is he?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Sure. Yeah.
They were out of line --
What?
So, that's it. I'm out?
Then what are you saying?
I don't understand.
Ruiz knows about this?
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
We get it. We're sorry.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Soho.
Yeah.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Ricky's taken care of.
Don't be shitty.
I will.
He didn't say we need guns.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Is that the woman from..?
Nah, don't bother --
You sure?
Yeah, I guess.
I don't know.
You would think.
About what?
You too?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
Let's just go now and wait.
Fuck...
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
The line's over there.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
He's on the list.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
'Strapped?'
What? Why am I bad?
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
You're from LA, right?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
So tell me how it is.
But, Max --
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
What?
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
And where might that be?
Who's up for a night on the town.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
Nnnnnnn!
I'll take your goddam bet.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
What have you set your mind to?
Yes.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
You have to sleep for three.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
I told you we don't know for certain.
Allah Akbar.
Sure, man.
If she got eyes, she do.
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
Murder.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
What does Sidney say?
You hear me, girl?
You better believe it.
Me?
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Tell him about Baldy.
Yeah.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Are you sure?
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
Am I a suspect?
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
[South America.]
[I have a friend there.]
I have connections.
I'll call you tomorrow.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
[Si.]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[The what?]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Lucky how?]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[Don't lie to me!]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
I came to visit you.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Different door. Not far from here.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Why not?
Time will tell.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Yes.
Your father has business.
Could I stop you?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
Planned what?
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
Do you know what she told me last night?
For a year?
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
When?
Our daughter.
That's ridiculous.
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
I already ate.
What was she to Creasy then?
What?
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
It's her baby too, you know.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
I know it pains.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Nothing.
Sure.
I'll see you around.
Sure, what?
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
Tomatoes.
You gonna get married.
You not ugly.
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Sure.
Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
You want a beer, Ang'?
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Sure, sure.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Be right with you.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
C-A-M-E-M...?
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
An eternal damnation.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
They're coming.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
Maria...
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Excuse me, Sergeant.
The one and only.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
There's only one worth noticing.
Homosexuality.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Damn.
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
With all of it?
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Against what?
No.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
No.
I guess so. Then what happened?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
No, no, no—that's your seat.
The Websters.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Wait a minute . . .
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
What's that?
There is no letter. I made it up.
A deal?
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Plus a bonus.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Take it easy, John Doe.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
That's—
Oh, let me go, will you!
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Sure. Mostly often.
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
It must be some kind of a gag.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
No, I didn't.
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
Uh-huh.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove—flopped into a chair—and has taken out his ocarina.
Shh!
What?
No, sir.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Is that where you're family lives?
Is there a problem?
...a car.
What's the suspect's name?
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
Sorry... Habit.
Like it had to be done.
I know.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
Is there something wrong with that?
Explain how that works.
Every couple of months, huh?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Why?
About six years. My partner took me.
Occasionally you lose.
He's cutting down the visibility.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
You worship yourself.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Can I come in?
Scott, You can't save everyone.
And it's hard to get.
Scottie...
It's very nice.
...Let me just show you.
Use your imagination.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
What happened to your Trans Am?
Who's running it?
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Okay...
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
No...
Not my problem.
In a computer program.
Yes...
Only up there in the dream they called life.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Why would I do that?
No.
Sorry?!
There?
-- Waiter.
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
What?!
Ah... sure.
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
... I just pray we're not too late.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
LET'S FLY!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
We could smell it's breath.
A stellar idea, Skull.
BULK!!
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Did I say anything?
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
GO POWER RANGERS!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
What's going on?!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
But I've never served a day.
But ya got a Boss.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Not another word.
Why should I be?
Can't we get a couple whores over?
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Who hired the bastard?
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
I can just imagine.
No. I'm here with you.
You're sure?
Why? You're the innocent one.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
Gives us something in common.
I'm doin' business here!
So what is the problem?
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
You gotta plan these things.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
The kid just called me stupid.
The name's Charlie.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
I got partners.
I found that out.
They do what I tell 'em.
And what do you want out of this?
Come on. Be polite.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Guess I'm just lucky.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Anything!
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Yeah...before your time.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
Bend over?
How much?
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Monkeybone...!?
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Ohhh, nothing.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
Who?
When'd you get in?
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
All right. You can come.
I don't <u>know</u>.
We like to think so, yeah.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
I'm sorry.
I can make my own decisions.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Thanks very much, sonny--
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Would you settle for a husband?
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
"There's more light here," he says--
I apologize.
Right now--everything I own--!
Huh?
Why me?
He's a house-afire!
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Great saints!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
How do you feel, champ?
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Henry Hill.
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Y-yes, Jim.
Ma! Hold him!
What stuff?
Than what?
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Emma!
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
I beg your pardon?
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
Mr. President!
For one week!
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
No.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Mr. President--
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
You're a liar!
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Convene?
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Oh, but this one is so simple.
And with your help--
Oh, just a day--
Why?
Some committee's got it.
He did?
Since sixteen or so.
Have I?
Well, if it's all the same to you--
It *is* not!
No!
No!
No! Stop it!
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Not another bill?
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
Yes, sir--
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
How's that, buddy?
Well--I can *manage*--
A Bill! Not *him*!
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Let's get away from here. 
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Go away, Nosey.
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
What do you mean?
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Maybe he won't get up.
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Senator Paine.
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!
Page boys!
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Some people like it.
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Sometimes twice.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Yes, you own it.
Uh-huh.
No!
No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Oh, I don't mind.
Uh-huh.
That depends on what they see.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
You have?
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
What did he play?
I'll get my hat.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm crucifying him.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Last night he proposed to me.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Me sir?
But your honor—
Wants to know who the heir is.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Yes.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Buffer?
Huh?
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
No, thanks.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
They can have the Estate.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
Take the stand!
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Binge?
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Yes, ma'am.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
I did what!
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
What, sir?
You try it.
Yeah.
No!  What do you want!!
Good kids.
Hmm?
Why's that?
I'm fine.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Right now?
My approach?
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Mr. Follett.
Stop now.
Now we're back on track.
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
I've had my moments.
Tastes good.
She seems very unhappy.
Yes, your honor.
Yes.
Yeah.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
You like me. How come?
Doc.  Ainge...
It's a pleasure to meet you.
He told you.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
I'm trying.
Why don't you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Something's bothering her.
No.
Be specific.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
You're upset.
Hello.
Which show was that?
Was it something that happened at school?
Really?
Nah... scotch.
Don't you like this?
I wondered what happened to her...
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Yep.
Jerking off?
I can tell you anything else.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
That'd be Lily.
See you Thursday... regular time.
What'd I do?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
What friend? You're my only friend.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
You shall see.
That's one way of putting it.
Intestines.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
Water turning to blood.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Proceed!
I would never!
Twenty.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
If you call that a kiss.
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Oh that's comforting.
We're about to be shown the way.
Who was talking about what?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
You dream about dead guys?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Got what?
I have no choice.
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
That just makes you more gullible.
Picked his pocket, actually.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Oh.
Awfully.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
You have got to be joking?
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
The Inscrutable Six?
I can't.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Let's do it.
What did he mean?
Sure.
Get on to yourself!
Ummm.
You're nuts.
Just a waitress.
Really?
Curiosity.
I saw him walk you home.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Date?
Why?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
What have they got that we ain't got?
Monica, where are you?
And what if you get killed?
I just know.
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
Good or evil, what's the difference?
And you are a fool.
LOOK!
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
But there's still only six of us.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
But I just don't feel it.
I can't.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Shhh.
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
Hey... he's gone.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
I always knew that you were special.
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
Definitely.
Sorry.
Shut up.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
But how do we get in?
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
Are you serious?
I'm not insulted.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir.
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Lisette La Croix.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
And you, Junot?
Are you trying to insult me?
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Yes.
No.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
Certainly.
Why not?
What are you talking about?
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
I couldn't face telling you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
My God, what do you think?
Yes.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Of course, my dear.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
Yes, sir.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
Yeah.
Good.
Why you say that?
I don't know!
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
What happen?
Black magic.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
You walked?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
Nothing.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
Me too.
What are you doing here?
Okay.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Well bring yo' ass on...
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
It's alright.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
I'll remember.
I saw it.
Come on.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
What up, bro?
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
You could sell your Beamer.
Let it go!
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Where's Craig?
Why did he go in the house?
This is a knock.
He's a boy, dude.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
That's my girl.
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
Sorry.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
I...
That's right.
I would also like to apologize.
You wouldn't...
What's your point?
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
The gun...
Tell me why he's dead.
That's right. That gives you...
You know what I'm gonna do.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
On TV.
No way.
Right.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
No, kisses to...
I'm just an accountant.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
Yeah, all right, listen...
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
What!?
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
I think this is worth a dollar.
I see. Where is this gun?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
I've done much better ones than this.
It better be.
Help me get her off the rug.
Come with me, honey.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
You, Preacher?
I'll bet.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Not even her?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
When'll the skiff be ready?
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
How do you mean?
Say what, Walt Spoon!
A man of the Cloth?
Icey, I don't want a husband.
The money, Icey.
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
Satan.
There! What's so hard about that!
You better not sing that song.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
Why?
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
John, where are we g --
Dead.
Huh?
Yes. Yes.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
No.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Our honeymoon.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
Harry, what --
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
Where's she at?
She took them kids with her?
What you been up to?
Now who was this?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Thank God.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
No.
Who?
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
You know he's dead though, right?
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
I don't mean her --
I won't.
Right.
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
S'curity.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Naturally, Comrade.
It's from Paris.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
I see.
Evening gown?
Just for the honeymoon.
Possibly.
Positively not!
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
That's right... and we might as well face it.
Yes, Comrade?
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
The Duchess...
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Good morning, Gaston.
That's all right.
Go to bed.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
It's a real Paris reunion.
Razinin.
Look for yourselves.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
Just looking around.
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
We did our best, Comrade.
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
Yes, Comrade.
Even the swallows are back.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Gladly.
No.
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohème... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Yes.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
Ni-notchka.
Thank you.
Wounded? How?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
What?
Then you should go back to your table.
Do you like Scotch stories?
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
No speech?
No! No!
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
...but big.
It is their wish.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Huh?
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
You can't imagine.
How do you do?
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
No thanks, Swana.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
What?
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
We have nothing to discuss.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Yes, it does.
Thank you.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
I figured that out.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Jesus!  Through a window?
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
... go on.
'Night, Al.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
I know it well, sir.
Sir?
We were working on China.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
Yes, Mother ...
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
What ... ?
What?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Winning?
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
We'll see about that.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
How a fat man gets so many girls.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
I was the lesser of two evils.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
The hell with 'em.
That's right.
Yes, yes.
No, sir ...
I know ...
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
It's over, Dick.
Is that the truth?
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
Can I just ask for one thing?
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
You're drunk!
The "crises"?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
I don't know. My mind wanders.
No.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Sheriff?
I don't know. He ought to...
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
Hyah!
Okay.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Just keep it up.
That'll work.
Yeah.
Goin' out.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Yes I do.
Yes ma'am?
What did you tell him?
She'll be all right.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
No me mate.
Why would I care where you're going.
No. Do you?
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
Yes.
You already asked me that.
Well...
You said that.
You married into it.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
I didn't put nothin' up.
Everything.
Uh-huh.
The kind with the most poles.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
No sir, it's unusual.
What room?
How well do you know Chigurh.
Yes?
I'm sorry.
The what?
Another additional.
How would you describe him?
I know how he found me.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
Yes sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Yes sir. Two tours.
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
No, Elden, I need to...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
Yeah?
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
Anyway, so what?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Maroon.  I stole it.
I gotta go make dinner.
Are you and Larry happy?
What are you talking about?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
You knew Del?!
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
Ad lib?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
David, please --
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
What's so special about it?
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Roy! What are you doing here?
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
He has a wife?!
God, that's awful!
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Who?
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
I don't follow...
My socks?
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Should I kill him now?
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Like... us?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
I said, 'No.' N-O.
What?
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
A doctor on the show... why?
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
Very graceful. Perfect form.
...who doesn't?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
He's waiting...
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
I said I'll think about it.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
I SAID FORGET IT!
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Sure.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
- and share one of your graves.
Do not seek the treasure!
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Fire! I hate fire!
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Four hundred, Delmar.
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
You -
Uh-huh.
That wasn't my doing...
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
It was in his bureau.
You didn't know that at the time!
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
Aw, that's all right.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
I am. Hur you?
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
He ain't our daddy!
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
I wrote. Not every week...
Naw. That's over with.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Come over here where I can see you.
No, sir!
Not exactly, sir.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
It's important, sir!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
Pardon?
No, sir.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
He was. He died.
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Great.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
What do you mean?
No way... Would you?
No. I never feel like that.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Seriously.
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
I've never had a girl.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
So?
I've seen better.
Yeah.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
But she expects you to marry her?
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
That's their problem.
You finish.  Then we finish.
Not that one.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Shut up.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
Yeah, whatever.
Adios.
Everything okay?
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Nobody leaves.
Why?
Open the door.
It doesn't work?!
Wait.
Feel okay?
Little bit.  Yeah.
Don't though. 
I don't know, why?
Come on, come on...
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Stop it.
Huh uh.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
What's with you?
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
N... N...... Not... Oh.
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Are you finished?
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
So what's the deal?
I don't know.
I don't know about that.
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Brimmer.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Maybe...
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I don't know. I really don't.
Uh... uh... I...
I expect to try.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
As do you.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
Oh?
I will do so as soon as possible.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Sir.
Yes, sir.
Are you going to meet with him?
It's already over.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
Oh?
Is that so?
No...
What?
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
It's Mister Marion.
Name five hundred.
That's five, keep going...
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Thank you.
Four, five miles.
But what about Thomas?
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
I hate that smell.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
I'm sure you're not.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Allman Brothers.
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
I think it is so, Ellie.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
I don't know.
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Is there quicksand?
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
You keep saying that.
Why? For God's sake, why?
Don't worry about that.
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Did you see his shirt?
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
She.  Goes.  Free.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
Men!  Are you up for it?
Aye, for us there is.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Then why aren't you eating?
It's a pirate medallion.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Boy overboard!
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
What?
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
I know.  That was for the smell.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Indeed.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
I knew you'd listen to reason!
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
How?  The key's run off.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
Jack!
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
... No.
My apologies, Governor.
No.  She hasn't.
Bleak.  Very bleak.
A moment.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Thank you, sir.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
Got it.
What happens?
That's right.
No, why?
No, no, I just feel wired!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
I don't know.
What did you want my hair for?
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Getting used to it.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
Like a glove.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
Oh yes you are!
That's right.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
It's a miracle.
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes, he might be.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
How-di-do.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Your house?
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Oh, shut up!
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
You're the Tribune man?
Is that so?
Huh?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Gloria Golden?
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
My play.
Your valet, sir.
Dawson, sir.
Quite so. Quite.
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you—
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Nothing.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Staring at us?
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Conrad.
Right.
Sorry, boss—
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
I have it here.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
She did—?
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
I beg your pardon.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Double strength!
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
The name is Smythe.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
No, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Very good, sir.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
... Sex.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
What?
Thanks.
Here's my favorite.
No ...
But I really should get home.
Oh, George ...
I was in a bowling-alley.
No I'm not.
No I'm not sweetie.
Um ... It's ...
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
It is?
Why not?
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Why am I out of order?
Oh sure it is.
I thought the books were blank?
Green.
What are you doing?
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
What happened?
What's going to happen?
What?
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
They don't have that kind of potential.
It's fine.
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
What?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
Right here.
Oh ... Hi.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
They just grow like that?
It was a prop for the school play ...
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Scout?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
Right. And how did she dress him?
McGinty's.
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
What the hell's going on!
My name's David.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
I can't.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Why?
I'm so glad you're here.
Yeah ...
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Yeah.
I brought you something ... From the library.
Just a little--You know.
Hey.
No, no, no.
Ok. Thank you.
D&D Mattress Man.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
That's your fault not mine.
So it's ok if I bring her.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Hello everyone.
No.
Yeah I can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
Hi, is this Jack?
I'm just laying on my bed.
Are you watching a porno movie?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
Are your pants off?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
You have a girlfriend?
You sound very cute, very nice.
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Really? Please?
No. I'm sorry.
I didn't lie.
I have to go.
Not very well.
Yeah.
Yes I do.
No. Not at all. It's nice.
It's terrible, no.
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Sure.
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I see --
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
Nothing.
Yes? I'm trying.
If you come to Hawaii --
You don't think you'll go --
Lena?
Yes.
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Yeah......yeah.....
This is funny.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
You left me at the hospital.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Please don't do this to me.
Can I ask how much is this?
......and this is confidential?
What's that for?
337.....I'm sorry....
Can you say that my name is Jack?
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
I didn't know you had a sister?
Hi Walter.
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
So what should I do with the pudding?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
Ok.
Yeah.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
What do you have in the house?
Alright, alright.
This is a bunch of bullshit.
What are you doing?
Right now, you're doing nothing?
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Nothing.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
Should I call you later?
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
At your service, Count.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
Enough to discern its tenor.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
Do I have your word?
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
Good day, Marquis.
A man after my own heart...
Your wig. Remove your wig.
An innocent child is dead.
I know, because I felt it myself --
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
I'm here.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
A few indiscretions in his youth.
Oh indeed?
Of course.
No. It most certainly was not.
You'd suffer in her stead?
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
Enough!
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
Don't start --
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
I am not a wealthy woman.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
Oh, but I am!
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Not you too
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
And he did.
To make pictures.
Randolph!
Uh-hub.
Why is that, Louis?
There's no call for that language-
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
How much?
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
Not for me.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
Who the hell's Manolete?
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Listen to me-
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
George...
Yeah, you're probably right.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
Herman.
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Get out
Again.
Again
CITIZEN KANE
Jesus
It's just that my movie is so-
It was a -joke, George
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
I'm Christ
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Jack! Enough!
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
When?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
No.
It's OK.
Come here.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
Positive.
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
What're you talking about?
OK. Talk.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
What friends?
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Right, the gym.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Oh. When are they expected home?
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Ever get an answer?
Mrs. Thorwald.
That depends on who "they" were.
I told you that --
Like what?
Where'd they take Lisa?
With that cast on -- you don't.
Did you get my note?
I don't know what you mean.
Well, I only quote from the best.
Lisa Fremont.
I'm not ready for marriage.
No.
Stella!
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
She pay you much?
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Get back there! He'll see you!
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
What?
You can tell that from here?
Would four of them -- ?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
There's probably one in the basement.
Smart girl.
How much do you think you'll need?
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
That's good news.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
Of course not.
Tell me about it.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Something too frightful to utter.
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
To get on home.
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
What?
Yeah.
Down in back.
Hold it, Jim.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
And you dropped it?
That's funny!
Yes.
I'm not hungry.
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
I was in it.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
Sorry.
Sure.  Sure.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
What's that pounding?
Stay here.  That was my son!
Yes, sir.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
Do you hear from him, son?
Well maybe she better start.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
We know.
I'm here.  Shut up.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
My gun?
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Goodbye, dear.
Good Lord!
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
No.
Leave me alone.
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
And your folks didn't understand?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Now that's true!
Won't mother be proud.
Dig the square wardrobe!
I'm not so bad.
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
Why?
I felt like it.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
See, we're very modern.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Are you?
You don't need to do that.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
He hates me.
My mother?
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
What?
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Gabriel, what are you doing!
No, baby. He wants me.
...whoever she is.
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Radio said.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
NICK!
Nick...
What the fuck is going on.
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
You told him about Nick's letters.
You're in on this.
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Jack. Jack Bangs.
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
Don't say my name...
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You shouldn't have.
Who wouldn't.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You said it a million times!
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Her brother.
Christmas... Eve...
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
And I worked there. For a year.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
Why not.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
NO!
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
Leave the tree.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Fuckin' freezing.
My what?!
It's a roach, guy --
Haven't thought about it.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
I'm just talking.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Thought you hate your old man.
What, working security?
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
No, man! No, no, no!
She set them up. All of them.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
I... sorry, Mister...
I'M NOT NICK!
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
Elois?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Pam Grier.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Did the two of you talk?
Yeah.
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
What? Snap out of it!
It's a change.
Sure.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
No, they're not.
Like hell I am.
That's your proof?
He don't tip.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
Down to my car.
Nice Guy Eddie.
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
Lie back down, and try to -
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Where?
That was the plan, we meet here.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
For all I know, you're the rat.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
He asked.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
We don't think this place is safe.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
This is what he was doin'.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Yeah.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
I suppose it is.
Maybe it's better that way.
What?
It's going to Sonora.
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
Hurry up.
A little hot.
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
A man I used to know.
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
And meet him there.
Good thing you didn't.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Finished, son?
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
All right, you didn't know.
All right, you didn't know.
What's there to be fair about?
I'm sorry. Let's go.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Yeah.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
He certainly could. About a month.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
What's the use.
I don't care what he thinks.
What for?
Yeah, we sure have.
Put on another one.
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Don't you even know your letters?
Good night, Steve.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
No. We're not stayin' --
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Oh, sure.
Thanks, Steve.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
I think he wants me.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Hey, I have an idea...
Hello Ray.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
He's so brave.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
No. I never date outside my race.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Can you feel that?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Listen to me I --
I don't care. You pick.
So, whatever happened to her?
It's okay.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
Saw who?!
Let me see the files.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
That one.
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
That's right.
Thanks, handyman.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
What?
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
What happened?
No more violence... No more violence...
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Why?
Let me see!
Oh Mom...
I'm so happy I could shit.
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
You scared me.
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
What a mess.
I certainly did.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
I certainly was not!
It's sugarless.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Yes, but I lent it...
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
You forgot something...
Now, here's a babe!
What's he know?
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Where?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Can we go there now?
Yes, I understand.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
What sort of danger?
As a man, you distrust me —- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
She could use a hundred dollars.
She can only use cash.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
I ought to know.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -—  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him —— white —— and the men holding him up between them.
A job?
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
That you love Mary.
I'm afraid.
Devil worshippers!
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
I have to go —-
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
But why come to me?
Uh—huh.
I think it's time.
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
She's not been here for a long time.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Please.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
It won't hurt.
Yes?
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Sister older or younger?
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Kids? What about them?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
You're in therapy?
Nothing I can't finish later.
Videotapes.
What kind of personal project?
Who's Donna?
Maybe you want to go.
Then do it.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Sometimes. Afterward.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Why?
You said you weren't always impotent.
How come?
And now you can?
Don't you get lonely?
Why not?
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
I don't know.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
You did that?
Mmmmm...
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
Not very often.
What do you mean?
Yeah, so?
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
Did you masturbate?
I take it you've never masturbated?
Radon leakage?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Do you have to say that?
I have a pretty good idea.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Why did you do that?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
You don't know that for sure.
You are in serious trouble.
What is it?
No.
Did you take your clothes off?
So will you, someday.
Nope.
Not exactly.
Yes.
Very much live.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
Is that what he tells you?
No? Not even one more?
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Nothing wrong with trying.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
God, you... you're mean.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
It'll just be me.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Yes?
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Sure.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Nick, you're so strange...
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
OK. I'll think about it.
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
BREAKING OUT
A wreck.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Sure thing.
Absolutely correct.
Of course.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
What show?
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Farley!
Flavors!
Fabulous!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
SIN-I-FUL
We're not confused.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
It'll just take a second.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
I love you.
Yeah, I'm here.
So I guess that's it.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Stephanie.
Me too.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
I am one of those guys.
No, we're paying for the wine.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
I'm working on it.
And Lexapro, yes.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
I owe her a call anyway.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Just a minute!
It's not even a mile.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
So you're going to stop acting?
She works for tips!
How do you know?
So what's the plan today?
Miles.
I want to go home now.
I'm a quick learner.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Yeah.
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Nope.
Thanks, Jack.
Obsessively.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Is what the money thing?
What exactly are we going to do?
You have to tell me --
Put me down, Jack.
Let's leave it alone.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
I'm fine. You rest.
You said it looked like a car accident.
Why don't you come in?
I know. I love that.
Hey.
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
How long have you been into wine?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
What about me?
Good. So did I.
Victoria.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
So what's happening with your book?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
I'm pregnant.
See you over there, Miles.
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
It tastes funny.
Who said I was going to die?
Hi baby.
...I will.
I'm here.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
Just make noises then.
Are you going to do this or what?
You want him coming in the house next time?
Yes.
From what?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
Edgar, come inside.
It's old Morgan.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
Where are we going to sleep?
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Don't yell at her!
What was the first thing?
Sounds like a virus.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
It's like War of the Worlds.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
Did it seem short to you?
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Didn't Paden tell you that?
How's Mr. Parker doing?
Ten A.M.
I haven't done anything.
I had to get up anyway.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
No hard feelings.
I've got a job.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
Why?
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
He'll be here.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
I'm done talking. Get out.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
Good luck, Mal.
Luck, I guess.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
What's she got to do with it?
I run the place. What can I get you?
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
You like a good saloon?
Me too. What's wrong with us?
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Okay -- for you.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
Spare me.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Almost right.
"Forever".
Even the fall from the plane.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Everyone you know is lying.
Viktor, you should have said something.
You're so good to protect her like this.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
Do what?
I do?
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Hello, is this Elaine?
So you did meet her?
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Is that a problem?
Please put your clothes on
Body double.
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
I've seen them all before.
I need flesh and --
What's that?
I'm already dead.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I do.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
I noticed.
Really?  Too bad.
She did... didn't she?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
I know.  Thank her for me.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
-- I bet you have.
Er,... good.
She looks a lot like you.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
My God, you've got one?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Taller, Viktor.
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
I didn't leave you.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
Yeah. Sorry.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Something I want?
What?
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
Yes, I am.
No.
You do?
I guess she did.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Maybe.
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Yes.
They scare me too sometimes.
Ghosts.
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Nope.
Slut.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
I didn't do anything --
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Metaphysical question, man.
He's right. Nice guitar break.
Pardon?
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
"Blood?"
I don't think so.
Not while you're driving.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Yeah?
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
Let it go.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Oh, yeah?
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
Aspirin.
And this is mine.
We're coming your way, man!
Shelby!
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Shelby --
Yeah.
Sorry.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Brought you munchies.
That's disrespectful.
Grant, you're sick!
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
What do you think?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
They're both a challenge.
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Shoot.
Eleven.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
He's after us again!
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
How do you know?
Ummm?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
I'll do it.
You sure do.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
That's me.
No.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
See.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Six. Got it.
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Forty-two minutes ahead.
This is Bandit I, come back.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
What does the old Timex say?
I ran into complications.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
We'll be waiting. Over.
I'm here.
Pick it up, Breaker.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
That's the point, Dickey.
Now, you just find him, son.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
That's correct.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Of course. Yes.
Maybe.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Mortal.
Yeah.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
I said I got his machine.
Look at the collar on that coat...
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
...So you made another deal?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
I'm here.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
What?
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
What's the time frame?
I can trust Rheya.
Yes.
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Whose side are you on?
What?
And professionally?
I wish you'd told me.
Not necessarily.
No.
Yes.
I'll go with you.
Book?
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
I did too.
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Rheya.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Do you?
Thank you.
Neither did I.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I want to stop taking those pills.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
No, Ma'am.
I came on at 8:00.
Yeah.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
So it was "love".
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
Claire...!
Let go!
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Yeah.
... Don't explain.
You take care.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
... I don't want to talk about it...
Absolutely.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
What're you talking about --
I'm sorry.
What's the difference?
No.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, I guess.
Shooting?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
No. No, that's okay.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Remember Little League?
Oh, sure.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Hm.  What a lump.
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Don't be pitiful.
Mm-hmm.
Get away from me, freak!
Hmf-hrr?
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
A spider.  Eight legs.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Just call me Spidey.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I hate people with alliterative names.
Thank God.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
Do you mind if I come too?
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
I'm here...
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
That's the understatement of the year.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
I'll try. Thanks.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Imagine how I feel.
Just drop me off here.
I'm not so happy myself.
No, no!  Not there!
Is you all little Adolfs?
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Looks good outside.
So long, Sefton.
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
And maybe a little something else?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Which one of you is what?
Sefton!
It's on me.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Then droppen Sie dead!
Some are not bad at all.
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
Stop it, Harry!
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
What's the award?
Me? What if she don't want me?
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
What do they always say?
It's not good for you, Animal.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Animal! Got a little something for you!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Good.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
We did it.
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Are you questioning me?
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
What did you say?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Not particularly.
Just don't drool on it.
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
Where is he?
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
On screen.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Why would you want to leave?
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
No, no. Thank you.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
Better?
That's right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Phasing? To where?
I was ordered to by the Captain.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
What did you see, Chekov?
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Spock's burial robe.
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
None that I can detect, sir.
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Goodbye, David.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
I'll need it, Sulu.
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
What about surface life signs...?
Come on!
Go, Sulu!
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
No, sir, no response.
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
Welcome home, Jim.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...

All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Yes...
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
Yes, my lord!
Steady. Continue on impulse power.


This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
You know what she'll say...
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
I see. Helmsman?
How soon --
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
KHAN!
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
I am understandably curious.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
The power of creation --
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Best speed, Scotty...
Uhura, patch me in --
The ship -- out of danger?
Or the one.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
You earned it.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
Who?
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
They just don't want us going in there.
All stop, sir.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Understood, sir.
Engage warp engines --
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Aft thrusters, sir.
Aye, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir.
I exaggerated.
... They do, indeed.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
We've done it before.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Cramps.
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
... My shoes...
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
I liked him better before he died.
... Best shot...?
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
Like what?
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
I was not.
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
How soon?
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
... You're very perceptive.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
Hm?
All right. The truth?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
You want the details?
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Right.
A spaceship with a missing man.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
You need me.
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
But you said toxic.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
How do you know this...?
Why not?
I see.
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
They did, Admiral.
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Aye, sir!
On speakers.
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Two?
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Tell her I feel fine...
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
But not you.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
There are caves in those mountains.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
You're what?
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Bye.
Are they in any danger?
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Recommendations?
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
... had regenerated.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
I'll be in Engineering.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Aye, sir.
Ask them.
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Make it so.
We have to find shelter...
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
What...?
But it's comfortable.
Or you could try lying down.
... I believe you...
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
I do not know what you are referring to.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Ready quantum torpedo.
Where's the Sphere?
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
I am the Borg.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
I told you, there's no --
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
Understood. Keep me informed.
Let's go.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Active.
You don't sound French.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
You're lying.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
On screen.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
Yes, sir.
Unless you'd like to stay.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
I'll keep that in mind.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Commander... we have a problem.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
The charge is murder.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
Can you - ?
We've been set up all along.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
They'll make it look like an accident...
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
I beg your pardon?
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
How can I trust --
Yes.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
I know what you mean...
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Do we report this, sir?
I like it here...
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Except us.
Aye, sir.
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Uhura, signal our surrender.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
WE SURRENDER.
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Not as yet, sir.
A lie?
What?
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
I know.
No.
How long is that?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
You're working late.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
Not tonight, I have work here.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
On my way.
It'll only work for one of us.

The resemblance is... striking.
With pleasure, Captain.
Do you have a moment, sir?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
How could I not?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Counselor?
This isn't about me anymore.
No!
This isn't real.
Understood.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
Not with the Romulans.
Just lucky, Admiral.
What sort of signature?
If you don't mind.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
Aye, sir
On screen.
Still well on our side...
Thank you, sir...
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
I've never met a human woman.
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
And the Senate supports you?
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
New worlds.
Why am I here?
What's this all about?
I won't defend my life to you.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
It is... invigorating.
He's a very unusual android.
Should I raise shields?
Let's go.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
Seven minutes.
None.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
I have a purpose.
No, we can handle this.
Thank you.
It's still the full price.
Thank you.
About five miles back.
They must have picked it up in space.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
When can we expect containment?
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Shermin...
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
What?
This is George Fox...
Okay...
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
What.
Flashlight.
Money.
Shit?
Shit... shit... what shit?
A drink.
You want to try it?
Music.
It was yellow.
Yes.
Three nights... two days.
No.
No.
When we get here.
Is that a baby?
Yes?
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
Yes?
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
Are you my friend?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Yes. Sing some more.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Nothing.
No.
Do they talk?!
I gave you a baby last night.
Yes, they are.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
In the cars, too?!
Get Fox.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
Bullshit!
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
No.
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
I don't understand.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Hey, fuck you, man.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
My God.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
Watch and see.
Forget it's there.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
Tonight.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
We should talk alone.
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
Only way I could stand your ties.
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
What?
What clip?  What was it?
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Strickland.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
She still loves me.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Black.  Jack.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
But that doesn't add, does it.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
You sure?
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
You never told me.
Aw, Mom!
Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Winona.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Not as much as you'd think.
Hi. What's in the case?
Why me? What do you want from me!?
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
Maybe cause he's smart.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
"Was?"
Collected shoes too?
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
The other reason?
You got a point there.
Sex.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Does Koessler ask about me?
Not about coming to see Daitz?
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
How are we going to find him?
I'm going to Amarillo.
Kulok.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
I already have an employer.
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
The same.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Shit.
I don't know about that.
No. Stop, come on.
You're a comedian?
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Just like that?
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Anything.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
...and even then...
...then ask where you met her...
What an asshole.
I'm a "Dorothy".
Oh... right.
You want this in black chips.
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...The red piece of shit over there...
...get the hell outta here already...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Right.
Right.
Right.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
Kinda.
What'd you get?
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Classy.
Bud.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Ah, there's the rub...
I just tested for one...
Well, let's hit that party.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
It's unbelievable.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
I'll be your winger.
She wasn't your type anyway.
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
He's trying to be an actor.
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
S'up Trent?
I'm not going to Vegas.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
What?
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
Vegas!
Whu?
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Did she, or did she not smile?
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Let's go.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
What?
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Hold on.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
She thought you were money.
This version doesn't have fighting?
It starts at eight...
...through the kitchen...
She didn't notice.
That doesn't matter.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
They're a finesse team...
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...It's on.
No.
...double diamond...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...it is so on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Be smart about it.
You don't have to wait three days...
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Yes. 
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
An eye for an eye!
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
Shut up.
I'm not hungry yet.
Ba Fa Goulle.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
The gun will be there.
We gotta move...
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
Sure.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
Then why have I become a man like you?
How did you find out?
Yes.
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
How do you know I come from America?
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Shhhhh.
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
No.
That's for you to find out.
Mike!
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
And when they shot me father...
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
Can you do it Mike?
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
How is your father?
Please say it.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
How's Mom?
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
Probably a year...
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
Just be patient.
He talked to you?
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You're unlucky.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Do you recognize my voice?
You just woke up!
Is that good?
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Did you speak to my father?
Okay, darling.
No, I like him.
Okay.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
What?
Sure. I love Venice.
What?
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
Ripley's plans.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Really? To Italy?
Tom, I don't love you.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
Aye, aye.
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Have you done something to your hair?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
I just don't believe that!
I hope she never knows.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I absolutely agree with Marge.
So I'm learning.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
I think you're right.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
Hello Marge!
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
What?
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Emily.  Just kidding.
What?
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
He says so many fiancées.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
I'll fix some drinks.
I'm fine.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Was who Meredith?
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
November 7th is my information.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
You have, yes.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
Who mam?
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
My name is Travis.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
I bought a couple of tickets.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
I mean porno movies.
My God!
Hello, Betsy.
Sure.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Kidding around... you know, fun.
You sure he's not Italian?
With the other hand, right?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
What did you do?
One-Ball McCall?
Stick up?
A girl needs protection.
Iris.
That's what you think.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I musta been stoned.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
Yes.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
Age?
Education?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
I know.
Neither do I, I guess.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Thanks.
You know how I feel about what you do.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
Don't let him do that.
I'm a field agent.
You suppose?
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
What's that?  Mason?
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
Okay.  What's the second thing?
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
Why me?
How'd they get it inside?
And why not?
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Have you got a cigarette?
Oh.
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
I'm not refuting anything.
Well, son, you're home!
Shhhhhh.
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
What's that?
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Harry, son.  Harry.
Can't wait.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Yes?
Yes.
What.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Sandra Sinclair.
Then I'll call you a cab.
No, sir.
Thanks.
Call me... Ishmael?
She's very pretty.
Wish I could say the same thing.
We live in a theater?
Aren't you coming?
I... I don't believe this.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Exactly.
Yeah, well, that's enough.
So, it is a blacklist.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
It's wrong, Leo.
Luke didn't smoke.
Not any more.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
I taught you that.
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
I thought you...
What exactly did you hear?
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
The war...
Yes.  Very.
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
No. Just a few hours.
Thank you.
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Different?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Look.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
I don't know, honey.
The little Brenner girl.
Yep.
Yep.
Yes?
D'you want me to order one for you?
Yep?
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
No. Here's fine. 
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
Yes, very.
I know, Mother.
I don't know.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Oh, my God, look at her!
You're doing fine.
Oh, thank you.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Yes.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Would you like me to go for her?
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
I'm awfully sorry.
What?
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
We met in court.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Criminal.
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
You are, aren't you?
Famished.
He was watching a ball game on television.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
Yes, but...
I don't give a damn what you believe!
You have a job?
Helping travelers.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
No, tell me.
No, thank you.
It's an uprising.
Growing a beard...
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Don't let's take any chances.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
No... wait.  Hold me.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
And he'll talk?
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
How soon?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
I'm not sure, but...
With smoke.
Of course.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
But can't you give me any idea?
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
Come in, boy -- come in.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
Excuse me.
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
You've no thought of going there?
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
I want it --
I can't.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
Afraid of what?
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
Get out of here!
I've drunk enough tonight.
No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
I know --
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
Three years.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Aye --
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
You can get out.
You're wrong.
Dream on.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
I think we should get some support?
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Who are you?
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
I was talking about you.
I know her friends.
Your father gave them to both of you.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
Yeah, I know.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
My father.
It's what Lauren would do.
I don't know. I found him lying there.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
Yeah, we do.
I know.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
You killed my daughter.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
I want you... to bend over.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
It's not what you think.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
Yes -- that is true.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
That's what I came to see you about.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
I assure you such power exists.
Okay.
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Yes -- I think so.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
About five months -- your months.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
What about him?
Is that what you're thinking about?
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Yes--?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
I -- I thought you were--
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
How long will that take?
This one could save your life.
Can't stand light?
Yeah.
He's my brother.
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
The Prince of Darkness.
They're gonna book us.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
The meanest!
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
For a ride.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
Okay, okay.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
I like Michael.
Oh, no, you won't.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
I'm tired now.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
In here?
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
No, I'm not...
Lucy.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Well, I...
No... no, everything's different now...
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Okay.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
I was here first.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
No.  Why?
Piss off.
Just listen.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
So what's our problem?
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
I don't know who to trust.
Watch Clark.
Cool it, Palmer!!
Ain't it there?
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Now hold on, you dumb...
Was dark... find a light...
It's shorted out or something!
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
The dogs?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
That's good enough.
We got morphine, don't we.
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
Thank you.
A couple of hours.
How far's that?
That far?
I am going after them.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
We going to make it?
Why?
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Everything that's been missing.
Anyplace but here.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
Hear what?
And everyone looks like us?
But you're only a mud carrier.
This is it?
But there's nothing here.
What are you?
Morlocks --
Excuse me?
Yes.
I'm used to that.
It frightens you.
This is the way in?
Vox...
I don't understand.
Alexander.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
No...
I'm a foolish man.
I don't think that's going to happen.
Got here as soon as I could.
Alex, it's just the zoo.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Oh?
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
I live with it every minute of every day.
I would.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
Good night, Alex.
Thank you...
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
More than 800,000 years.
I can see Kalen's point.
Learning was important?
It must have been safe.
Orion's belt...
Is it?
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Exactly correct, sir.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
I took a different route.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
That's too bad.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
My business?
You sure you know where to find one?
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
No, we were patients.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
They should just be looking harder.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Yeah, but I don't know what.
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
[Beat] What?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
Yeah.
Yes.
I know.
I know.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
I don't know.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
There're no cars on this street.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
To the hospital.
Good. How's your mom?
Ok.
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
I never knew my father. Did you?
Why?
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
What for?
Where are you going?
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Yup. That's me.
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
So you never knew your mother?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
What?!
See ya.
Yes, baby?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
Tell us about him.
It's him.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
My Lord.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
You're a little angle, you are.
What the fuck is going on?
Christ, sure... yes!
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
It's nothin' like that.
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Why now, Jimmy?
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
Oh yeah.
Am I in trouble?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
Okay.  I will, too.
How come he let you go?
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Yeah!
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
Yes.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
I won't wait up.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
What happened?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Yes!  I believe I am!
Alright, Louise!
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
I can see that.
Thelma!
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
Shoot the radio!
Hit it.
Are you alright?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
We can change our names.
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Oh.
Why?
How do you stay so positive?
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Fuck you.
Fresno.
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
So you admit it?
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
He implied it.
Yeah, but he was successful.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I don't know what to say.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Call you back.
You got a brew?
Big time.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
You found my car?!
Dumbshit.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
No thanks.
You own a home there?
Some buildings I'm working on.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
-- He's in a cage?!
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
That...? Vestibule.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Who the hell's Woogie?
You don't buy what?
No.
You can't be serious.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
No, not at all.
Three different guys?
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Surprised?
You're a sick man, you know that?
Same here.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Kim and I are close friends!
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
How'd you manage that one?
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
Fucking sickening.
I never said that.
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
That must make it tough.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Healy.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Where would I have seen your work?
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
You mean he's not a criminal?
Oh Jesus...
Hi, Mary.
Oh yeah.
Just a minute.
Really? I never got a message.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
What are you?
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Mary, come on...
You forgot your keys!
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
You got what stuck?
I wasn't trying --
So what's up?
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
Bye, Ted.
Admiral, I asked you a question.
Yes, sir.
Where the hell are you?
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
I think it's a bad idea.
This is from the Highest Authority?
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Rug samples.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
Again. Figures, man.
James Looks Twice?
Oh, yeah -- right.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
Seven.
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
Beats the hell outta me.
Good.
Cooch. You're my hero.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
That's right.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
You're steppin' on sign.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
He knows me?
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
Why should I tell you.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Crow Horse, listen --
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Sorry.
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
That's right. Turn around.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Ray. What's your 20?
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
Leavenworth a tough joint?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
How the hell do you know?
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
It's not that.
Well, it is. It is that, too.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
That's all!
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
You know. The finger.
For what?
Apology acknowledged.
Too aggressive?
What are you talking about?
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
I'm starting to sense that now.
Make what?
You're an animal.
It's not suffering anymore.
About as much as they think about killing me.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Hardly ever.
I sit. I think. I play games.
True.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
Who's gonna win?
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
I hope you find him.
Well what?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
F-14's sir.
What is he doing?
He better be kidding!
You.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
NO. NO GOOD.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Roger, I've got it.
Okay.
But I have to!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Any more MiGs?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
On what?
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
I've had enough...for now.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
I want him!
Time to go.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
Let's go. Eject.
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
I didn't ruin her.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
We did it.
Nope.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
Bad?
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
All right.
I know. I was there.
My wife's house.
It's not true.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Over there man.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
How'd you find me?
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
No, sir.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
It's about goddamn time.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Brunette.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
That's right.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Swallow this.
Any news of Quaid?
O.K., everybody pull out!
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Melina!
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
Up to the right.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Level 2.  Galleria.
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Mmmm.....
I don't know.
But I'm always home by morning.
Do what?
All right, forget about it.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
Implanted.
I'm honored.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Mars.
What's in the two week package?
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
What's he talking about?
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Jump!
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
Oh, since when?
The reactor.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
My cannon.
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
No.  We go straight.
Could we make it to the mountains?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Why?
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
The rifle.
Sons of bitches!
Me, too.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
We got a plan!
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
No ties.
You are so full of shit...
You bet.
Yeah, Val.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
God, what a stink!
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Why do you all keep asking me?
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
He was your snitch.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
Sustained.
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
Shut your sewer mouth!
Not at all --
Of course.
Right. You're right.
I specialize, Roger...
-- Remember?
You really think that's what happened?
"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
-- You found his mugshot?
Roger Baron.
...What do you mean?
You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
I'm not that desperate.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
-- Me? Neither.
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
I don't need sleep!
...Okay...
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
Don Reynard.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Calls for speculation.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
No? Then what did he say?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
Get lost Bobby.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
Here he comes.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
Tell me about the letter.
Sorry to hear it.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
How come Jack let's you work here?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
That's what I heard.
I don't know, Sam.
I'll get my kit.
He probably wanted to drive over.
I don't know what to do.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Maybe.
Donna, are you my best friend?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
No... No...
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
I am The Muffin.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
James...
Not now.
You know it and I know it.
You mean the ones you pity.
See what?
Trees?
I understand.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
What were you doing in my room?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Mom, take it easy.
...school's fine...
Stay away from me.
Oh, Leland.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
Look at this finger here.
Who am I?
That's right.
I'm fine.
Yes.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Yes. It would be.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
It's a crime.
I... yes.
I...
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
No.
No.
I know of him.
Through, through his book.
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
Objection.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
When she...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
It was good of you to meet...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
The Doctors were not negligent.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
'Code Blue'...
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Yes.
Yes.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Yes. It was, actually.
I think I will.
Maybe what?
Do you want me to go...?
Isn't there something you...
You're talking like a drunk.
If I don't 'grow up...'
It's over!
What is that to you...?
Stop pressuring me...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I've got nothing to say to you.
And ask me what?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
It's locked.
...I know. I went...
Yes. Yes, I have.
...I understand...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
Don't touch anything.
What?
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
Admittance form is wrong.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
The Doctors.
The broad has disappeared...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
In New York?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh. And why is that?
Yes.
Me, too.
We'd be in all the papers!
Come on out!  We're friends!
All right - I've seen enough!
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
But I think I know where she'll be....
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
What's he like?
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
So is the town, I notice!
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
What?
I don't follow.
Chase...
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
Everything is not fine!
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
You have a fever, sweetie?
Bye.
Rex?  Who's Rex?
Say how they find their way back home.
The mean old man with the claws.
Not sleepy.
Coming for you...
Here.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
They wouldn't let me...
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Yep.
You miss him.
I can take it.
Claiming their place in the world.
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
I didn't know sir.
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
Whatever.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
Me either.
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
No, I didn't.
Me too.
Look, I just better go.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Forget it.
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Jesus, you never told them?
Speak up boy!
Unfurl the squares!
I don't know.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
That's enough.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
Trust me donut.  I know.
You know what he is talking about here?
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
What?
Long enough.
Sir.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
How old are you?
Well... Yeah - okay.
You was in the Marines, huh?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
No, haven't heard of it.
What's that?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
No... She's fine. Back home.
Set one up.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Sailor... Lula loves you.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
I couldn't say, which one?
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
That bastard Pucinski...
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
What I made you do, mama?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Why, honey?
Peanut...
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
Didn't he say somethin'?
No, he picked me up.
Here she goes again...
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
Yeah?
She got me an abortion...
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
What kinda trash talk is that?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Come look at this.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Where?
I'm goin'.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Yeah.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
No radio or TV...
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
The only one.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
You talk to 'im some?...
Oughta make 'em happy.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
That was in Vietnam.
I'll bet.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
That's not why I called.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Santos...
Yes.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
No... But...
Santos... I can't...
What?
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
So?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
I didn't see nothin'...
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
So I hear.
He's right, you look horrible.
How are you, Crabtree?
She's a transvestite.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Because... because...
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
Only in your bones?
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
Ye-es?
So what's the problem?
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
That was MacCaulay.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
I peeked.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
You must be mistaken.
How long have you been having them?
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
With Emily?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
It's very convincing.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
A little.
It's colder in there.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
I had to. Didn't I?
You?
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
So where have you been staying?
No.
Your aunt?
Glaucoma?
Where's that?
How can you tell?
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
I never said that.
When nobody's looking.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Just checking.
Who does?
Simple.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Caps.
You got me.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Really, Sara, I...
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
I think I might have.
Dozens. It's very sad.
Oh?
I told Walter.
It didn't come up.
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
I know, but sometimes...
Why yes. How did you know?
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I'm in love with your wife.
I don't know. It might be...
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
The perpetrator.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
How is she?
When can I see her?
Is it because of Anna?
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
How old is Anna?
It wasn't like that.
When?
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
I mean... feelings.
Is that right?
The mother sure has her hands full.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
It's hard to describe.
It's a bright sound.
I'm not pretty.
I have no idea.
Why don't you just tell me?
I could get a search warrant.
You can't talk to me like --
What?
They grow outside, don't they?
I fell asleep.
I went to bed around seven.
Yes.
Yeah.
Why's that?
Can I ask how old you are?
How come?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Are you sure?
They sound like finches.
Ms. Kramer.
I can't.
I know because... it's just something I know.
The job's okay.
I said the job is okay.
I'm still thinking about it.
It's okay.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
I don't need someone else.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Have to talk about something.
We have a few more minutes.
I couldn't say.
I'm afraid not.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
I want to talk about it now.
That's my answer.
I don't see --
In my bedroom, sleeping.
We're little kids.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
Accept you?
Most women wouldn't choose it.
I thought you were a dyke.
I'll buy a plant.
Sorry.
Yeah, they could.
Why do you want to know?
The morning?
How young?
Which brother did this?
Who doesn't?
You're such an asshole.
I'm not scared.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
Your rig?
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
You noticed.
I don't know, look around.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
What's the plan?
Who then?
No.
God, I hate that bitch.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
I'm thirsty.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
At what?
More so than the shark?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Are you joking?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
And why did you drop them?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Why?
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
No.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
To the shark.
But why all nudes?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
What do you think?
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
There too...
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
We'll try again.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Here I am.
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
No, not like this one.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
And do you remember where she got off?
From Panarea. Why?
What boat?
They didn't seem too good.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
Is that possible?
Is that far from here?
One of the other Sisters?
Who?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Who told you this?
Why?
Who tells you these things?
That's not what he meant.
Who?
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Would you like to talk about it?
Do you remember the night they said it came?
The baby they made up.
Where'd it come from before that?
Agnes, how are babies born?
Then let's talk about something else...
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
No... do you?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
No.
I could never be a mother.
A mistake...
I'm not sick.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
I breathed!
Yes.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Doctor Livingston.
Because I'm in trouble.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Because I wasn't worthy.
No.
I can't tell you that.
I'm afraid.
I hate them.
Someone's following me.
Do you know who put it there?
What do you think it's there for?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
How did she know about him?
Where?
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Yes.
Who?
Agnes, who did this to you?
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
Yes.
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
What?
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
The one up on the third floor?
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
What business is it of yours..?
No-one.
Yes.
Yes, but I...
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
Then help her.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Answers.
Earthquakes?
Yes.
What is it?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
I don't think I care to know.
I'd like yours too.
I'd love one.
Hand rolled.
Saint Peter?
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Begin what?
For the Church?
This is insane.
She is an innocent.
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
Where is she?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
That's a lie.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Y'what?
How about Ding Dong?
I'll murder that Lennon.
They'll be here.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
You crawler.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Sorry.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
I'll look in here again.
It's Paul's grandfather.
How'd you guess?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
What's that mean?
Is she?
Parading?
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
What?
Me!
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
What little old man?
He's got you worried, then?
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Shall I?
Foreign devil ...
So's mine.
You needn't bother.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Well you're not going.
Hi, our lot!
No, not me.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
I would have said so.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Y'what?
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Don't start. Look.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Good lad, Ringo.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Clever.  George.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
And they want me?
A proper Aborigine.
Or something will be able to see us.
Where the hell are we?
Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
What's the terrain down there?
Then take her down.
Looks like a derelict.
No, I want to go in.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Hard to say.
Shit...
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
The water will still recycle.
Right.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
Ask him.
Careful, don't get under it!
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Still unconscious?
At least it can't get up here now.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
Good!  That's good!
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I've completely lost their signal.
I'm trying.
No.
Oh... God...
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
We can use the flamethrower.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Is it armed?
Feast your eyes.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
Yes, thank heaven.
Let's get moving with this net.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Yeah?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Turn on navigation lights.
Found what?
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Good.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Food-storage room!
I guess we open the door and net it.
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
Let's be democratic.
Right now let's keep it closed.
So the next step should be --
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Is it dead?
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
Nooooo!
Has anybody talked to them?
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
What?
Yeah, I got it.
Thanks.
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Sounds great.
What is that?
You've checked that end?
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Only six?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Hold on...
Agreed.
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
I... I can't!
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
You should hit the sack, too.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
Phoebe.
I call myself Phoebe.
Please do.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
Eddie...
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
It wasn't meant to be.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Almost four.
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
I'm in love with Lloyd!
... and Karen.
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
I don't know what I take you for anything...
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
I never intended you to be.
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
What of it?
She never proved anything, not a thing!
No-no-no...
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
Hear, hear...
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Frankly, I don't remember.
I take it she read well.
Where?
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
As of this moment you're six years old...
When - when are you coming back?
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Sing it?
See you...
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
That never stopped you before.
She's a girl of so many interests.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
For instance - you!
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
Gone.
Don't mix your metaphors.
Margo, let's make peace.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
I just wondered.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
Are you proud of me, Bill?
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
But she just got here...
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
Buy some.
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Hmm?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
No.
I - I guess I fell asleep.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
- an understudy's performance.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
I'll never get over it.
Something most important you can do.
Not at all...
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Why not?
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
They're your fans, your audience-
Harrington.
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
I can't believe Eve said those things!
Check.
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
Where'd you get all that information?
I wonder why.
I'm trying hard to follow you.
Now just a minute!
They'd die without each other.
What are you going to wear?
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
I just played it.
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Would you?
I promise.
Answer my question!
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
Yeah?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
--a spy, you mean?
We need a sympathetic face.
--fifteen phone calls--
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
Facts or theory?
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
Nixon.
--we will--
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
You want me to be the bastard.
--has he got an ax?--
--I haven't said anything--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
If he self-destructed.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Who?
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
11:30.
The telephone calls... we know about that.
This?  Naw...
I've got a lot of energy.
I know where Dwight works.
Chapin did contact you then?
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
And?--
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Which people?
Who were they?
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
I don't know titles.
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
--I'm not here.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Where?  What do you mean, where?
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Who?--be specific. How high up?
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Howard Hunt here.
Good God!
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
I couldn't say.
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
--well, Sloan--
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
When so ordered.
Haldeman.  Right?
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
Because I want to.
That's nice.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm not playing.
What's that?
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
What?
I do, baby, I do.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
But --
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Right.  That gives us...
Just in time.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
He's going in!
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
You fuckin' rule!
Yeah.
These are for you.  From father to son.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Michelle.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Highly, highly overrated.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Strip?
Move with the music.
God dammit, Stifler!
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Okay, don't stop.
Not for you.
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
No...I know the perfect time...
Yeah, are you?
I want to hear you say it.
Yeah.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Once, in church, dude.
I'm such a loser.
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Stifler!!
Dude, he does not.
Uh huh.
Doing what?
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Uhh! Would you die already!
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
A cure?
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Fuck me...
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Well, they are French.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Or else what? You'll kill me?
And you call me a moron...
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Sure. Don't you?
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Oh shit... No...
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Why the fuck would I do that?
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Andy? Andy is that you?
Sort of...
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
Come out! I can do alterations.
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
I have my reasons.
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
It's not you - it's the dress!
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
Is it? Is this what you want?
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Bartok... a question.
What do you mean?
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
Run, Anya -  go...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
Young	man, I...
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Yes.
Why not?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Tsch.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Well, no... not just, not only.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
No, Chippewa Falls.
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Nice car.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Yeah.
Okay.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
think that's, uh-
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
No, so help me.
Okay.
Yeah.
As Balzac said...
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
Yeah?
M'hm.
M'hm.
Yeah.
U-huh.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Yeah.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
You don't want me to live with you?
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
Well, have you ever made love high?
It relaxes me.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
U-huh.
Let's just do it, all right?
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Following is different. I was spying.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Who cares? Who cares?
David? You call your teacher David?
M'm.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah?
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
Oh.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
Yeah.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
W-w-whatta you mean?
Oh, I had the radio on.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
What thing?
Thing?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
I'm cool.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Yeah.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
You're mad, aren't you?
I'm late.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Why are you so hostile?
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Oswald and ghosts.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Whatta you mean?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
Look, uh...
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
We're gonna operate together.
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
I look pretty.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Oh, yes, yes.
You think so? Do you really?
I just have time to get the, uh-
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Oh yes.
Very well.
You're fucking desperate.
She's got great tits.
No, what?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
I'm in mourning.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
He's allergic.
Didn't I say?
You want a Tylenol, or something?
I love you, Joe Therrian.
Harry called.
She's in ICU.
She left a note.
We live next door.
Excuse me?
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Nice to meet you.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Let me heal you, baby.
Not as a rule.
Hey!  Would you?
I love you, you're a genius.
We've only been over this how many times?
There's still time to undo this.
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
Hardly...
Through the sweats or not?
No.  I missed that.
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
Truce?
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
He'll find his way back.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Otis!
It's a novel.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
I'll never forgive you.
Everybody hates the messenger.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Oh.  You're serious.
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
Very well put.
We're way past inappropriate.
I think he's really angry with me too.
How long have you been married?
I like you.
Sorry?
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
I'm sure you understand.
You're not serious.
Why?
Sally?
Oh?
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
What does that mean?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
What are they?
I don't mind...
And here they are!
Ah.
Why are you doing this?
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Right...because every ant's important!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Wanna dance?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
No...as a matter of fact...
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Want a list?
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
Mom!
Barbatus?
Duty calls!
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Oh, no, sir!
Thank you, sir.
That's correct, sir!
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
...Ants...
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
I can't think of any.
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
Care to make a small wager?
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Why?
Really?
Yeah.
How come?
You shouldn't.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
How many of those drinks did you have?
The mirror -- it's broken.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
Let me help you.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Baxter.
Miss. 
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Pick a card.
A cemetery?
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
I don't want to talk to him.
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
I don't?
Oh.
That's very wise.
Shut up and deal!
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
I don't know.
What kind of joint are you running?
You better.
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Relax, Baxter.
You too, sir.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
You?
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
I have a vague idea.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Let me get my bag.
Just as long as she's okay.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
It's regulations.
Aren't you?
Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
No.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Good night.
Who?
A.W.O.L.?
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
I took sleeping pills.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
I promise.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
He wouldn't.
The nerve.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Go where?
It's a thought.
Oh -- oh!
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
I like all of them --
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
None.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Who are you ?
Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
Yeah, it is.
I know.
Yeah, I know.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Signs?
Which way? Right or left?
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Would he remember you ?
Yeah, it still runs.
Charlie?
This gentleman or myself ?
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
A lame ?
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
What about an American named Kurtz?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
What, sir?
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
I got bored in Saigon.
Who knows.
I met him.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Music?
What do you mean, Colonel?
You can't have water after morphine.
No water.
I'm taking you back.
What?
Yeah... thanks.
Which one's the Colonel's?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
When?
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
No -- leave it --
Why?
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Why did they attack us?
You're Australian?
His name is...
I should be checking on the boat.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What did you hear?
Yes.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
Why?
Be careful -- there're two of them.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
I'll tell you everything later.
New to the country, kid?
Yeah.  Maybe so.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
-- Turn around.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
Shut up!
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
But I would.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
What are you talking about?
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
It's a long shot.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
Huh?
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
I've got Jews at my table.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
No!!! Stay away from me!
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Is there another way to see it?
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
It's one idea...
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Yeah... Well...
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
I had to see you...
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
I just love her.  How're you doing?
I'll take care of myself --
You think you're kidding.
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Two years ago...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Do it.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
What?
Well, I can't reach them.
Ask him.
What's he look like?
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Get out.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
Melvin...
I'm going back with you.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
I forgot to lock the door.
What's it mean?
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
What restaurant?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
What?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
No fucking way.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
Yes, sir.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
One hour per man.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
How did you get into the business?
You were like a boy genius?
They tried to kill you?
After that?
That's fiction.
You said you didn't trust it.
Nothing.
Why not?
No.
Here?
Yes.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Check.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
Except --
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
Yes.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Yes.  Here I am again.
So?
Did he explain how this happened?
Are you attracted to me?
Yes.
Honestly?
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Martin.
Oh, God.  I see it!
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
Everyone regrets something.
Sure.
It's a common question.
A dime.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Go ahead.
That's correct.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
And not even then sometimes.
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
You sure got a handle on that word "we".
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
I thought that was part of the charm!
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Tough break.
No....The Asylum!
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
We don't speak Czech!
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
What?
What?
Tell me some bad news?
That bad?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
What happened?
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Lucky break!
Siberia.
What are you talking about?
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
That one?
So am I.
No!
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
There's nothing there for me.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
It's not so much.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Yo, dobree!
What for?
No, it should be over soon.
We don't need you.
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
I had it coming from someone.
That's right.
Fuck you!
A kind of freedom.
No!
Not all of them!
You may use my office.
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
Yeah.
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Just yesterday.
Maybe it is!
Well come on, sit down.
Why?
Go to hell!
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Some Americans?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
Heart be still.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
I'm sorry about how we --
I don't want his money.
He wants to show now.
Late night.  You?
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
I need to whizz.
Me.
What kind of a man are you, son?
-- This your idea of small talk?
Were?
-- Your act only works with an audience.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
The world of the dead?
You don't believe in anything?
Yeah --
Thank you. So were you.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
You don't know what you want --
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
No.
You're sometimes not sure?
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
I was twelve.
What about your father?
Pull over.
I'm sick.
I'm not going back to school.
I was going to fake it.
Lower. Same page.
Yes.
Dad --
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
I don't want to see her hurt.
No.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
Please.
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
Scalene?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
I beg your pardon?
No....
Have we ever met before?
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
What drill?
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Yeah,  Right.
Pro! Release the rope!
AM or PM?
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
Ssshhhhh!
A mall?
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Jesus!
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
What? 
Sure,.
Dick? Dick who?
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
He said not to tell.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
Okay.
No, he showed me one.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Yeah.
Mmmmm.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Thanks.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Well, stop the world.
I know.
Okay.
Don't ask me.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
He was nervous.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Positive?
It was going too fast.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
I just don't want to go.
Yeah.
Stay as long as you like.
Yes.
Maybe.
It's mine all right.
Beats me.
Then that's it!
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Arachtoid.
Not really.  This is pretty important.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Don't shoot!
This is so embarrassing...
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Which?  The one in my throat.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
You don't wanna know.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
A what?
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Why me?
I didn't drop 'em.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Flying to Cambodia.
Please, Barton.
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
I want to know!
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Drown all those rascals...
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN –
It's still a little early for me.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
He's a great writer –
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Yes... Isn't it?
Well, you just... sound a little–
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
That's all right, really –
Hi, Charlie.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me – I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
What do you mean?
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
No... Can I come in?
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
Yeah.
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
I'm at the Earle.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Yes sir, they –
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
Nine days – Tuesday –
What do you do, Fink?
All of which he's now missin'.
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
She was there, wasn't she?
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
No.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
She said what you said she'd say.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
No, Nick, please --
Nilsen.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
Tell me about Catherine.
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
What?
Yes.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Don't get too cocky.
You can make a mistake.
Fine.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
What's it about?
To see if he can get away with it.
To see if I can get away with it.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
No.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
I never have before.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
Of course I knew.
I found Lisa Henderson.
No.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
It won't sell.
Somebody has to die.
Somebody always does.
How did it end?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
Do you remember his name?
I hope I helped you out.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
What are you doing here, Pop?
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
You don't like punk rockers?
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
We bring her in for questioning.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
No.
It was an accident.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Are you vice?
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
Really. Huh. Too bad.
Not sure. How was yours?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
What about the shit they write?
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
It's in New Jersey.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
What's wrong?
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
No.
You haven't been by lately.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
I'm here.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Yes, but as a black painter –
You're not?
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Oh – you mean black people!
For real?
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
You don't have any fucking money..
It's Monday morning.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
You mean babies with you?
Hi.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
It's three thousand dollars!
That's great.
Stand still.
Have a Mac.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
Jean Michel Basquiat.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
A what?
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I will relay the message.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I'm -- sorry, I --
...four, five.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Maybe you're right.
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
Yes and no...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Photojournalist.
Nor I, on the second.
Weird, huh?
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
No, just give you a splitting headache.
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Too late for what, dear child?
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
What seems to be the problem?
That, sir, does not compute.
Specify, please.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Oxbridge Academy?
I recognized the accent.
Keep it.
Hey, what's your problem?
You'd be surprised.
Alfred's happy here.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
I hate being lectured.
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
I can make it.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Maybe he melted.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
But he's never said a word-
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
She wants to kill you.
I knew you could handle it.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
Adam and Evil.
Not good.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Then you never loved me?
Well, I can respect your opinion.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
Dr. Meridian...
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Recognition, of course.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Tonight's a good night.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
Just ones this beautiful.
On occasion. Usually at night.
Wacko? That a technical term?
Not much.
That's usually my line.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
What?
What are you talking about?
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
Bruce, you can't.
Yesssssss. I know!
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
Fred?
What the hell is going on here?
Never heard of a double-cross?
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
Miss.
You sunk my battleship.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
What are you talking about?
... Murderer...
WHICH CAR?
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
... A hundred and eight?
Well -- I think you might consider
Better. It's not on the market yet.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
As far as I know.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
I wish you'd...
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
No one would miss me.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
... Where are you calling from?
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
Take 'em! I want his head!
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
What are you talking about?
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
It's gone.
Yeah. Deja vu.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
One.
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
Annie, it's me.
Isn't it?
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
I beg your pardon?
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Er ... pray tell me why?
And a car.
A car sounds sensible.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
I am sorry you feel that way.
Nope.
What?
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
No it wasn't!
What's your problem Beavis?
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Yeah, really.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Uh...
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Deep and hard.
Not now Bork.
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Yup. Huh huh.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
How's your arm?
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
This is going to take some time.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
<u>You</u> left me.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Of course I did.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Maybe we should knock first?
3:30 I guess.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Really.  I don't know.
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
No.  What's wrong?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
<u>Out</u>.
We're...
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
No, Lydia, we're dead.
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
And live in what, our station wagon?
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Yes.
No, dummy.  Two.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
I saw some ghosts.
It wasn't a joke.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Why not?
The attic.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Hardly any, Robert.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Thank you.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
No. I like this attic very much.
Your family doctor?
No. I'm a gardener.
Yes.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
... Mentor...?
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
Hello, Eve.
Thank you, Eve.
How is Ben feeling?
No, thank you.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Thank you, Eve.
Yes. I like to watch.
Hello, Eve.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
I agree.
Oh, good.
Yes. I am very hungry.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
Yes. That is correct.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
What sort of bed is it?
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes.
Oh. Thank you.
I never needed money.
Yes. Of men and women.
Of course. I would like to look.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
Yes.
I am a very serious gardener.
I live here.
I was given meals, and a home...
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
But you won't sign, correct?
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
No, that won't do any good.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Right, Chief.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Thank you, Colonel.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
It's that serious, huh?
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Yeah.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Tell your friends.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
The monkey.
I'm a puppeteer.
Yeah. You want a beer?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
Yes.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
The iguana?
You came up here looking for the portal?
That... was... no... simulation.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
Schwartz.
Yes?
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain “doors” which should never be opened.
You're insane.
No, really.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
Just.
Yikes.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Hello. Wendy.
Ha ha ha!
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Hush, sweetheart.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Can I be anyone I want?
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
But I think I have another plan.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Do you mind?
Oh, Lotte...
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
Lotte called me.
It's okay, my sweet.
He's a selfish bastard.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
I've got to leave Malkovich.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Derek Mantini!
Whatever.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
Was a time I knew what was.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
I will.
Ya think?
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
Morning, ma'am.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Mama?
Oh I been out.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Aw, no, Ella.
That's so.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
For what?
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Yeah. Look bad?
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Why me, man?
Shit.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Come and get it.
We have the urn.
That is for the urn.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Walter, how--
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Where's your car, Dude?
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
Well--
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
Far out.
Nancy's pretty good.
...Also, my rug was stolen.
Separate incidents?
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
What's your drink, Dude?
Thank you.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Uh-huh.
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
Hey Walter--
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
It's your roll--
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
The nail polish, Walter.
But Walter--
Nihilists!  Jesus.
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
The bulk of the series.
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Is the car out front yours?
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Wha. . . Donny--
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Dude, I'm sorry--
Right, Dude.
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Are you employed, sir?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
WHAT?!
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
I said out.  Now.
Stay away from me, mister!
A world of pain.
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
The House of Pain.
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
Nothing.
What?
For what?
Why?
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Then who does he work for?
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
I don't know about this, man --
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
You experimented on your own, son?
Scud.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
You should've killed her, then.
Just do it, old man.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
But I just got here --
I'm sorry, I --
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
And that's a good thing?
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
What do you see here?
Like me.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Cancer.
I'm not leaving without you.
I know. Take some of my blood.
I was afraid that might happen.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
Then what is it?
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
You've been listening in the whole time?
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
Habit, mostly, just like this.
He killed them?
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
Join the club.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
Bullshit! Talk!
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
So whoever built this--
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
--whatever; that's her.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
Why is there no "our" here?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
I want to see the tapes.
--Cotter's--
--you should get back into bed.
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
I can't.
I can't let you in.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
What? That made her lose the baby?
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
What're you doing with all this shit?
--coming out of the water--
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
Too busy eating us?
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
No idea--goddamitt!
How's she going to know where to--
--I don't know.
--Domini!
--Graduate Thesis--
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
Spite.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
--oh, Jesus--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
What'd you say?
What?
Sure. I'm sorry.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
She's off her fucking rocker--
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
Does she, goddamnit??
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
What happened to my Dad??
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
See a guy.
I couldn't believe it either...
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Abby... you all right?
Yeah.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
I don't know what you're talking about.
...What was that?
With your gun?...
I think someone's watching.
Remy.
Going out with Meurice.
We don't seem to be communicating--
What?
...Friday?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
Back where?
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
You owe me for two weeks.
How long did you watch her?
Ya catch any fish?
...What kind of fish?
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
Nah, I trust ya.
Right.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
For what?
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I'm not sick.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Yeah.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
. mommy's here.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Nobody.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Well.
Never before this.
No.
See my nipples?
Don?. Are you in with them?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Please. please stay.
I sure don't hate you.
No. it's not Don.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
Here's to Ben.
Okay Frank.
Yes.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I don't know. he moved away.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Alright.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
Yeah.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
Okay, okay. Bye.
That's what I thought.
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
No.
I can't dance fast.
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
uh uh.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
You'll see for yourself.
You'll see for yourself.
Derek!
You happy, baby?
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
You're a fucking amateur!
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
We want some grass.
No.
It's your grass.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Nice doing business with you, George.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
No fucking way.
Get me a six pack.
I don't want to talk about it.
Murder.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Good night.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Just a friend.
We're half a million off.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
No more brothers, Diego.
You fucked me, Diego.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
Oh, I see.
It would be my pleasure.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I'm going to California.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Dad.
No.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
Tuna.
Tuna.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Out.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
Yeah.
Dad.
You can call me Dad if you want.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
You swear?
But I've got school.
It's alright, Dad.
Shhhh.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Who's the co-pilot?
Yes, I am.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
I understand. What's your question?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Sail.
Second district ...
Third group.
Don't move, Hacene.
It's true.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
It's a question of habit ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
How can I give you this statement?
Yes ... But let me first see you.
It could've happened to anyone.
You got something on the coke?
You got something on the Coke?
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Thanks, Mister D.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
How?
Then you can go.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Yes.
Sex.
No -- never.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Aren't they all?
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yeah.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
About a year and half ago.
Yes.
We were lovers.
For about one year.
Intense.
It didn't.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
No further questions.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
Sorry.
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
No pain, no gain?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Hi.  It's Frank.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
Yeah.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
What?
She's mistaken.
It's only the beginning.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
Honey.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
I love you too, Dad.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
Mr. Roston?
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
I'll talk to him later.
We have to talk.
No.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
What time did you leave?
We were here two Christmases ago.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
No treasure maps, huh?
Aw, Betty.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Michael.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
I never knew that.
Was this during Betty?
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
They got heat in Michigan.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Oh, that'll be nice.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
I don't mind waiting.
Oh! You caught me.
Must be nice having kids.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
Clean?
And clean.
I think so.
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
I told you, I love other people.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Oh, sure. Great.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Oh, how is he?
How about Italy?
Why?
Trouble. Why?
Yes, thanks.
For who?
Yeah. It could get better.
TO HELL WITH YOU!
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Sure.
Hmm?
What's her name?
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
What happened?
I don't remember!
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
You people really don't like dogs.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
How the hell should I know?
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
What the hell you talking about?
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
We met.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
You mean as opposed to your life?
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
That place is already bad luck.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
I can't find you.
Back here.  At the end of the block.
Let me see it.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
Not that I remember.
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
What we have to do is call the police.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
I can't.  I can't.
Jesus, Caesar!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
There's no time.
No!  They're still on their way.
Why?
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Caesar, what are we going to do?
No.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Not until he has the money!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
You need the money just like we do.
Everything you couldn't.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Shut up!
Yes, I understand.
Pretty good, sir.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
No.
What?  They ain't there?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
All right.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
Not exactly.
He said you lost something.
No.
So am I.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
What choice?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
Yeah.
Good.
Johnnie?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
An accident.
He won't.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
I'm here, aren't I?
Pop?
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
I think everything is okay.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
One moment, sir.
Yes.  Is he there?
...I understand...
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
It's a little late for that.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I know that.
Where are we?
I can't believe I slept.
I don't remember any of this.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
Go ahead.
I didn't know this would happen.
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
What?
xxxxxx
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
I tried.
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
No.
I won't forget this.
...Yer nostril?
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
... new washer.
What? How do you know my name?
Layton.
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
Beginner's luck.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
Jack!
You sound worried.
Even later.
Really? - God, how time flies!
Er, I knew you looked different.
Not much.
He's a freelance subversive?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
Is it stamped?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Information Adjustments.
Oh.
Who are you?
No.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
I didn't like it.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
What?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Well, terrorists of course.
What?
You're joking.
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Are you still following me?
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Yes.
Don't do anything silly.
Take care.
It's not our mistake!
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
Don't worry.
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
The refund for Tuttle!
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
27156789/074328/K.
A woman eh? I see.
This is your dream girl, is it?
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
I won't be held responsible.
I'm sorry but ...
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
Mother!
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Fixed itself.
Have you got one or haven't you?
We'll be back.
What is it?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Mary ...
Mary, we really have to go.
Just take it easy.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
Ten-four, hon.
What's his name?
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
Yeah?
The first is always the best.
She should go home.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
He's better, though, right?
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
How long you been doing this?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
Maybe I should come up with you.
Fifteen minutes.
No, no.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
There's no time.
Frank.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
That's too many.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
He was tough. You did all you could.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
I've taken that into consideration.
Who with?
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
That's ridiculous.
Frank!
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Faster!
Used to be my partner.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Yeah.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
Yes.
A half hour in the lobby.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
Eleven and a half.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Good.
As good as humanly possible.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Then it went well.
No.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
Sit down, stop.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Your hair's a little funny.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Move away from me.
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
Yes.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
Yes, there is.
Right there, Bobbie.
One's enough.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Okay.
I'll speak to you.
No.  Not even you.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Yes, sure.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
I trust you.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Great.
Because you're nuts.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
A picnic?
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
Not anymore!
Oh yeah?
I'm going home!
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
I didn't finish talking to you!
Shh!
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
N-no...
I already told you I'm not.
You're breaking my concentration!
Anything new?
Is the manager cooperating?
Righto.
Of course...it's wonderful.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Me too.
Walter!  Jeez!
Every word...
Bye!
That means you like me!
Walter, I'm sorry...
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Just about anything, Walter.
Is it?  I've forgotten.
I'm totally serious!
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
Why not?
I know.
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
I said I did, didn't I!
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
A parakeet?
Have a seat -
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Well, w-what did you do?
Yeah?
I can't talk right now.
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
Huh?!!!
Smack?
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
Yes, get rid of them...
I thought you didn't respect money!
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Really?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Gee.  Thanks.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
If you see him.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
We hate you guys!
Bummer metaphor.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Down there.
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
'Bye.
No...
Hi there.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
Yeah?
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
I'm going to the senior dance.
What for?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I should have known.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Nice ensemble!
Where?
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I forgot.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Try to pay attention.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
A what?
Don't start with me again.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Thanks.
Sorry.
You're having a fling with him?
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
I'm just a girl.
No --
But --
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Throw it out.
Buffy?
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Okay.
Nice much.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Run.
You can learn to like it.
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Get over here.
Yes I do...
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
You don't have to...
--but you're father's in there!
That's great!
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
That's my job too.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
Let me.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
What's it say?
Ninety-five miles an hour...
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
He'll learn.
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
Oh let's not...
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
Beg me again!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
Well, I held it like an egg.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Let go of me!
C ' mon!
You fuck!
What?
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
We're getting married.
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
We're eight and sixteen.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
Why are you doing this to me?
Good to see ya.  William would you...
Liar.
He's lying.
Philip, if you would rise.
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Excuse me.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Right away.
Okay.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
Eight.
Hey.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
Okay.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
All right.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Hey.
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
I'll be honest with you.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
I lost control?
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
No, a...
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
I -
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
It's me.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
You bet.
I'll come by.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
What can I do?
No. Just stop everything.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
What is it?
Oh, no.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
See you, Ginger.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
Hey, Mitch.
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
Yeah, I know all that.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
No.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
Okay.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
No, you don't.
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
What do you mean?
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
What's it...
He wanted a watch, too.
Fuck you!
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
You're not takin' Amy.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
I can back him off.
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
I should have -
You want your jewelry?
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Oh, you are...
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
That's amazing.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Green?
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
Hey.
Please.
If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Now move along.
Nicky, I did -
I did - I didn't -
Nicky, I'm sorry.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
Calm down! Calm down!
Stay out of the way!
We can't help him if -
But I'm just trying to leave.
I know.
I'll tell him, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
He's good. He's fine.
I understand.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
That's enough now!
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
You're so nice. 
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
I did what you told me to.
What about my money?
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
But I saw something...
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Ginger, honey.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Okay?
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
Here.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
'Go! Go! Go!'
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
Hold it, hold it. Here.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Then do it the way you want.
Yeah.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
In women?
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
It may be time to get the police involved...
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
"Well done," Cactus.
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Absolutely.
Now he'll be up all night...
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
Spear.
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
Stop.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
I actually got some memory back last night.
But of course you are.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Actually, yes.
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
Don't you have children?
Taking messages.
You could've made me lose my call.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
Yes sir.
Or relieve me of it later.
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
Will you let me explain!
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
Then hang up!  Do it!
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
What about the others?
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
A woman?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
No.
I'm trying to.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
Why can't it be her?
You're going to let them get away with this?
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
Who is this?
Didn't we play this scene before?
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
There are no guarantees in this life.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Got a phone in that van?
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Government business?
Undercover.
Did he?
Yeah?
Persistent.
An excellent quality.
It's Dave.
Please, Dil --
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Bloody right I do...
Guy I work with.
He's Scottish, Col.
Jimmy?
Hi. You forgot your bag.
They all get the wrong idea.
Yes, thank you.
He wants me to perform for him.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
You can't leave me then, can you?
No, I didn't --
Must be.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Yes, please.
How different?
What do you think?
I am.
Yeah.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Don't call me that.
Never said a truer word.
Must be.
Make it up to me, then.
Probably.
You can always pretend.
Stop it, Jimmy.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Don't be cruel.
Only if you kiss me.
Anything.
Afraid so.
No! I'm going home...
Prescription. For my condition.
Did you hear me?
Love you, Dil.
Never.
Stop it, Dil --
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Carnations.
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
I know.
What do you mean?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
And what happens then?
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Peter.
Would make me feel better about it.
Should blow you away, you know that?
Definitely unusual.
Aye, I do, Peter.
A hotel?
Am I?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
I didn't even fancy her.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Suppose you could say that.
The fastest.
My pleasure, Jody
Give us a break.
Don't be so sure.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
What do you believe in?
It's as simple as that?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
No.
Stop that talk now --
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
You won't run.
Hurling --
Hurling --
Who gives a fuck.
Whatever you say, Jude...
Thought you liked me, bitch.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Why do you think I brought you here?
You're going to look for him -- now?
With whom? Where?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Agent.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
Were you followed?
Agents.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
But no one actually saw him die.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Brian.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
The view had better be worth it.
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
Then who does?
Reggie?
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
There must be some way.
Reggie -- listen to me --
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Cutting it out.
You did.
That sounds like their problem.
Maybe.
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
How often do you go through this little ritual?
It's a start, anyway.
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
What do you mean?
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
In money.
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
Leave me alone -- !
But his mother --
I'm very confused.
I don't know.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
Up there! I would put it up there!
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
Quitter.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
I don't know where to go.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
How would you like a spanking?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Be careful, Peter.
Don't put yourself out.
Don't you want me to stay?
The American Embassy.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
What?
We will separate -- you look over there.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
I get the imports.
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
I want you to head right home after school.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
You are upset.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
Are you sure?
She just turned off her light.
She's still a virgin.
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
You know where I can find her?

Daddy....
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
What are you doing here?
What?
I'm sure you should have failed.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
You know about that too?
You eventually have to talk to him.
I was desperate. It was gross.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Why?
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
What?
I did.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
I do not.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Yeah. Who is she?
That's what he said.
What?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
His mother's side.
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
Did you want one?
Ok.
No.
I'm not leaving it here.
But you don't really mean it.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
You're being unfair.
Yes. Unfair to me.
ROD!
Okay, okay.

I think I gave it to her.
Do you know him?
Would you call him a capable man?
His girlfriend?
Yeah.
No. She's probably scared to death.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Yes... I think I can manage...
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Curly, where's your car?
Where's that?
I don't know...
Jake, listen.
Okay.
I said okay, Jake.

You're welcome to try. There he is.
No.
No.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Matter of fact I do.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
What for?
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Of course.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
A check?
Well, how much would you like?
I have?
Why?
No reason.
Another satisfied client's wife.
No.
Why?
I gave everybody the night off.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Yeah.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
You didn't tell me.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
What did you do that for?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
Katherine.
She's my sister.
How about a plane?
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
When did you come in?
Oh no.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
Oh, good.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Drowned, too.
Yeah.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Yeah.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Yeah.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
But that's what you told your wife.
She ran away?
Why'd she run away?
Come in, Alfredo.
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Progress! It always arrives too late!
That's right, Modern Times.
Yes. 
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
Who?
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
Somebody stole it.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
I can't take shorthand.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Two cents.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
You don't really think so?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
You know why?  She was so -
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Yes -
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Charlie?!
Hello, Bernstein.
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
We've got a nice plant here.
Yes, Mr. kane.
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
Charles.
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
I'm not sorry.
You can't stop me.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
Can you prove it isn't?
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
All right.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Charlie -
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Charlie!
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
That's the train with all the lights.
You won't be lonely, Charles...
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
It's a letter from her lawyers.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
He married you, didn't he?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
I'll have a highball.
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Are you serious?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
How long have you been a smoker?
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Can I join in?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Exactly.
He went home to change for the big date.
I feel nauseous.
No, don't!
Dante. You've got a customer.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
So you're really getting married?
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
I hear that's a rather popular date.
What about Sing?
Sang.
Nobody. It was closed.
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!

I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.

So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?

Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
That's frightening.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancé.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
All right, Vader's boss...
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
Can we talk about this later?
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Why not?
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Sorry.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
I'm going with you.
That's embarrassing?
I swear.
Yeah, but at what a price.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
I don't want to talk to you.
You want to rent a movie.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
I know I'm your hero.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
Five hundred dollars.
I'm not.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
Could be.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
I was born.
I should shit or get off the pot.
What responsibility?
Oh, like your life's any better?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
I know I can bench more than that!
I'm her sister.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
Yeah?
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
It's not my store.
He died in the bathroom.
Maybe.
Meaning?
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
Bunch of savages in this town.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
I touched a nerve.
Three including you.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
Why do you say that?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
What's this?
WHAT?
You said you were here all day?
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
That's tight. Solid.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
No, I wasn't.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Bye. 
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  C'mon let's rock an' roll.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
I don't know.
I copy.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Would you?
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Okay--I don't know about this.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Sure you can.

When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
I don't think you do.
Jess--you look good.
Can't do it.
You got to go back now!
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
You attacked me.
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Next time, date only basketball players.
Get it!
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
I burned it.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
Sue me.
What are you talking about?
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
Let's move your ass in there!!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
You bastards... bastards.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
Try the wine!
Thank you, sir.
Help me, sir?
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Well, shall we get down to it?
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Keeping fit then?
Well, how are you then?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
You're gonna be sick are you?
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
No, sir.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
Fine. Fine.
I haven't seen you before.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Oh.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Prison custody?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
Are you feeling better?
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Oh, my, yes.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Can't say that I do.
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
What thing?
I've been calling and calling.
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
What happens if you don't?
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Two, two-fifty.
Max.
Okay, try it now.
It's a mess.
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Tonight it is.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I need the job.
Yeah.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
What difference does it make?
It's not bullshit.
In case <u>who</u> checks?
Dmitri?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
Some living.
That's what you said...
What happened to you?
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Who?
Geronimo?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Why the hell not?
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Mississippi?
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Shut the hell up.
Motive?
I can't promise you anything.
I think you're different.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
For what?
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
Six months.  Eleven days.
What is it with you and the space program?
Surprise me.
Is he dead?
You watch me, don't you?
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Not today.
This way.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Because he believed me.
I can't promise you anything.
Now she tells me.
Could you be a little more specific?
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
You've asked me that one three times.
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Working.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
This doesn't make sense.
Tell me about it.
You don't understand --
I was just thinking that.
Wasn't my idea.
And Jonas?
Where do you think Jerry is?
Yes, sir.
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
No, thanks.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Meaning...
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
What?  Why?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
Actually I'm running late --
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
Put it on speakers.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
This is how you see the sky?
It's beautiful.
And a hundred mile airspace.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
A page-break signal.  A period.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
And?
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
-- I'm moving to Washington.
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
It's really happening.
Like it or not.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
Why?
Something like that.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
The final countdown.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
In other words.
What is it?
Have your department make a full report.
Git movin', I said.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
She's got him! You hear that?
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
Hey, Tattoo!
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
He's gonna be awright.
A Lucas Jackson.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
That's it. That's the end.
Like an elephant.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Take it easy, Drag.
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
You just said he could eat anything.
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
Forty-five.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
What are you talking about?
Fear of what...
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
You already made the delivery?
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
She don't want it.
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Nothing.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
That's no surprise.
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
Well, thanks.
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
I'll get a locksmith.
What else?
Over here.
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Just horseshit luck.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
You came in there with this attitude...
Honest to God, Ruben!
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
Helen Hudson...
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
Thank you.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
You should have gone to the funeral.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
One of your suitors?
I work in the immigration department there.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
Yes.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
I did this already.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
Yeah, and a dimple.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
And the party?
She said she'd be here at 10.
What about the engagement party?
Do you think I should?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Ecru.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
I know.    I know.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Tomorrow?
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
Letty.
Terrific.
No.
I wasn't hungry.
Very romantic setting.
Good God.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
Don't be ridiculous.
What are the delusions like?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
Break up?    They wish.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
Your family just met me.
Do you?
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
It's sex time.
Yeah?
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Always the drugs.
I think I should call someone.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
And all the plans we have.
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
Yes.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
No.
He's a patient here.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh.
Sure, I understand.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
You killed her!
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
What?
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
I'm not here to negotiate.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
Thank you.
I know they won't be home tonight.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Where are you from?
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
I think he's already figured that out.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
What'd you get?
You haven't answered my question.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
You said don't do it, boss.
Everything?
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
I'm the driver.
I'm not going to leave you.
What the hell is he talking about?
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
Me?
No.
The hell it is.
Cool.
Where is it, Sophie?
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
Thanks.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
The lucky ones.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
A little?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
What's it to you?
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
He is my defeated foe!
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
What do you think?
You're probably right.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Only the sword will settle this.
Then you have no use for the sword.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
Give it back!
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
It has.  How's business?
Yes.
I left the training early.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
No onions?
No further.  I'm serious.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
I saw it, too.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Who?
A remembrance.  A closure.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
She's still dead.
Murderer.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
I don't know you...
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
I can see her.
Magic.
Does it hurt?
Yes.
Leave me alone -- !
Fine with me.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Is he inside?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Annette Harrison.
I don't think so.
That's right.
I'll be fine.
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Forever.
No.
It's not really important.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
You talking to me?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Please.
Give me the fucking letter.
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
Refreshing.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
It's my house.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Of Human Bondage.
I will.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
Why are you doing this?
Where are you going?
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Doesn't ring a bell.
Any ideas who it could be?
Where did you say she's from?
Greg McConnell.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
No.
I am?
That's one way of looking at it.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
Good night Cecile.
I do.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Honey, is something wrong?
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Jesus!
Get out of here.
Likewise I'm sure.
Ronald?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
Racist piece of shit.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Even there?
But who will they turn to for help?
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Cecile.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Where is she?
Oh yes.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
Excuse me?
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
I have a flair for drama.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
I accept. Now get out.
And if I don't?
That's beautiful.
I'll do that.
Do you know where she is?
It's really important.
Oh... no thank you...
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Don't worry about it.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Oh, lots of times.
On the back street — a green house
Are they nice?
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
It's early yet.
Yes, darling,
I'm never unfair.
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
Well, you know where it is.
I suppose so.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
I'll show you.
It was on account of the birthday party.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
It's true.
But...
Yes, darling.
I don't know yet.
You called me by my name.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
For as long as you'll let me.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
No, thank you.
Good.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Now, I don't know Amy --
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
Go on -- out with you.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
I've been working out.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
So don't look in his eyes.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Give him the tampon test.
Okay. I guess so.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
No you don't, believe me.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Okay, I gotta go.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
You should have seen it erect.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
I think I already have.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
I guess you'll find out.
About Mark? Carlton?
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Starving.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
No.
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Oh my god, by wolves?
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
Interesting possibility.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
No, my bite's a lot worse.
They do? Oh no...
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Worse than this?
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
No, take it.
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
What makes you think I was the last one?
Packages of money.
Tell her I'm eating.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
And that was 28 days ago today.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
How will we interrogate them?
Good.
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Iím sorry...
Who?
Don't know much, do you?
No.  Have a look.
Wait, this isn't fair...
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
Not that again...
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
We are...  living in their dreams...
You're kidding?
And we're going away for a holiday.
I promise.  I won't.
Great.
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
No...
Well it's a last minute change.
Great.
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Yeah.
Fine...
TilT we figure something out.
Mild stroke?
Up and around?  Soon?
Yes.
Fine.
Clean.
Are you out of your mind?
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
He's only doing what you told him to.
The government
I'm not sure.
You could buy it on payments.
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
I see what you mean.
A teleprompter.
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
Fertility beads.
What do you mean?
No.
What about it?
But it's ten-thirty at night.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
The Vice-President...
Thanks, Duane.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
I don't know.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
Oh... Okay.
It's just so strange...
You have a lot of secrets.
I run a temp agency.
I know.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
It's nice.
We're doing our best, sir.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
Quiet!
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
Oh, I have no doubt.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
What is the Dead Poets Society?
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Hey, this is great.
And English, and trig
Except sex.
Oh come on, Pitts...
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
So much the better.
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
That's not my fault.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
AHHHHHH!
Don't stop!
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Isn't there an easier way?
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
I'm calling her!
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
Then you can help him.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
What is that supposed to mean?
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
From my father and Nolan.
It's my birthday.
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
I have a schedule...
Then you better start swimming.
Did you clear this?
I saved your life is what I did!
What are you people talking about?
You hear that?
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Keep tasting...
Yeah...
Right...
No...
I'm stuck...
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
One whistle... Start the engine...
Where is everybody?
You want some too?
Maybe plans changed...
Hey! Come out here!
John...
Yeah.
Those are mine!
Good... Pass the beer.
John,we're going huntin'.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Hey! Fuckin' A!
I'll get it! Where is it?
They did not!
Jesus, it's freezing!
So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
She does not!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
What hospital is he in? Where?
No.
But I insist.
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Naw.
You know a guy named Merle?
Oh, well...
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
Inside, Vince.
No?
Linda... Hey, Linda...
I don't know! I don't know either!
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Oh, it's great. Fine.
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
Who the hell knows!
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Yeah.
The shot?
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
From Nam?
Pow.
I'm doing that too.
What do you mean?
Merle...
Sit down.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
No!!!?
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
That's my plan.
Listen, Nick --
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
No.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Phantom Mary?
No.
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
Up.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Wade's here.
What did you say?
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Your mother.
Put that on your political resume.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Out of the room.
I'll be alright.
And I want Doucet.
Where?
You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Yes.
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
My insurance won't cover it.
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
Simulated one.
How ya feeling?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
And you should be with your family.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
Good to know you, Willy.
Hi.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
No -- that's for me to do.
I didn't.
That's my problem, Belle.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
That's just too bad --
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
Opportunities?
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
Well, I'll be -- 
I don't care.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Well -- yes --
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Coming.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
We can still use my butter money.
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
There is nothing to worry about now.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Oh -- Jabez.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
I don't know, Jabez.
All right, son -- if it helps.
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
I say -- it don't matter.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Sure, Ma.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
I guess we won't.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
I won't forget.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
It's okay, it's okay.
That is Christmas music.
Ellis, what have you told them?
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
I'm a cop from New York.
Then don't waste time talking to me.
When you're hot, you're hot.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Oh...Where does he live?
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
How do you know?
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
Yessir.
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Come on, what's under this?
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Yeah.  It was terrible.
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
Where you gonna go?
I know I am.  I know!
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
You don't have a choice?
Look... who's on the phone?
Do you still want the operation?
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
What are you doin' in there?
I'm not alone.
Call me whatever you want.
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
Sonny, come on out!
They were ...
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
It's all we got.
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
I don't know.
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
No.  I had some legal training, but...
It was on the TV.
No, not until after they killed him.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Let's go, Sonny.
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
But I want to know what you think.
All right ... send them the guard.
Wyoming.
Yeah ...
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
Let's move it, goddamn it.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>I forgot.</i>
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>
<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
What about your toe?
Did it hurt?
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
What?
<i>The combination code is tattooed on his right arm. You'll never get inside Edna Fender's safe without the code-breaker on that arm.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Domino rides shotgun with her CELL PHONE to her ear.
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]

It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
I can certainly think of one more!
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
Do you know where Danang is?
In theory.
We should sign her to a talent holding deal. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- NEXT

If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
Jade, I still love you.
Two dollars!  Forget it!
You a troublemaker?
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Yo, I'm gone.
See ya around.
He's completely innocent.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
And move to Long Island...
Twenty "C" Duracells.
Can ya dig it?
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
What?
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
I got no say over people.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Tonight, when we close.
Where we goin'?
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
To get my money.
You're still late.
Magic Johnson.
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
We're outta here.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
I love you.
Tell Vito.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
'Bout time, Pop.
Whaddup?
Actually we have something for you.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Four colors? Neato!
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
I don't follow.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Probably because we've never met.
Why not?
Shift to your left.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
Who's Captain Rob?
What?
She did not.
Shut up!
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
They can't be real.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
Put some ice on it.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
HARRY! Here he comes.
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Some what?
HARRY!
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Who?
Yeah, that's why I asked.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
I don't know what you're talking about.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Tomorrow night?
Let's just do it and get out of here.
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
You were born free and free you should remain.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Uh-oh. Harry?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
And...?
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
Just like the President.
With your permission...
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Basically...
Is this what you seek?
Would you really have drawn my blood?
My Lord?
Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
Excellent!
Where are we do you think?
 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
Yes...
Yes...
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
Always.
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
Long live the fighters!
Pain.
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
I predict we're lost.
I have no next picture.
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
That's good.  I could use the money.
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Dracula?
I didn't feel well...
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Formaldehyde.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
You mean a Tesla coil?
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Boris Karloff!?
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Does she have room for me?
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
That's not true --
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Oh, of course!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
We're escaping!
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Maybe it needs special handling.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Uh, atomic energy?
The sun.
Who's Dr. Tom?
Let's get married.
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
Lines around the block.
Yeah...?
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Who?
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
Yeah. Ma...
Who?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
Al!
What?
This is real, Bananahead!
A woman wants to be pursued.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Tell me.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
When? Today?
Right.
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
He says --
Could've been a nurse?
And what did he come back now for?
Mom?
It was horrible. He called me up.
The doctor said you were having sex.
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
Shari, Ray feels --
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Welcome to work, Ed.
Yeah.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Ohh...
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Come on, let's go.
Somewhere.
Come on...
What?
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
It's nice.
Where were you?
We're excited.
I don't know.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Oh, Jesus.
Great.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Cassie...
Ray, come an--
Ed... I'm sorry.
What?... Why?
Sure.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Here, get down.
Anything wrong?
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Yeah?
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Yes, I do.
I know.
Ethics are...
Right
Sure
As far as I know, they--
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Looks like today's your lucky day
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
Hello, Tracy.
Sporty.
Uh-huh.
I've got an idea.
My house.
Would you sign it for me?
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
Walt needs to see you.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Oh.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Still clear?
We'll let it run awhile
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
I know.
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Don't you fucking knock?
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
Till 19-fucking-70.
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
I'm not sure.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
That simple, huh?
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
What work?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Yeah.  A great big one.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
Until he gunned down six people.
I never truck with no sissies!
They shot him in his library.
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
What?
Just don't shoot me.
Give me a minute, will ya?
I want you to follow Bud White.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
You make a mistake?
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Not good enough.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
And Reynolds?
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
And no one'll know about this?
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
I'm telling you, I--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Be careful, Danny.
Why?
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
I don't know who he is.
Who was that other guy?
Who are they?
Yeah.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
And you won't. Now move--
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
Look, my wife is understandably--
You told me no calls.
How do you know so much?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
How'd you have the manpower to--
Looks like Detroit.
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
How fast can you learn?
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Oh my God.
Neil, thank you for your help.
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Yes. I have her permission.
Is that good?
Thanks.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
A report?
What kind of trouble.
I can't.
Somebody took my blender.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
No.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
Just for the criminals.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Well, you know--
It's not real...  That's not me.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
That's gonna end tonight.
Sir?
I don't believe it is, no.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
Brill.
All right, look--
Will you hang on just a second.
For the last four years.
How?
It's not me?
Yeah.
We believe he did.
--otherwise we may have to--
My shoe?
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Fuck off.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Usually they take clothes.
Bobby--
Rachel's dead?
Why would the NSA--
You're tired.
Listen to me.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
I need help.
Are you still in Crystal City?
The police?
Yes sir.
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
Fuck you.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
Sir--
We believe?
Oh, let's assume that they have.
What's your ETA?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
What kind of fossils?
I don't care to bargain.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Yes.  Absolutely.
No.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Good.
That makes it harder still.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
Don't do this.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
I can't move.  I can't get out.
I know.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
Sorry, what's your point?
Could I trouble you for some water?
What?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
In my room.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
I don't know.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
So was my Patient.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
What?  How could he have?  When?
I liberated it.
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
Moose.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't… I couldn't even do that properly.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
What?
To arm-twisting.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
Thank you.
I can already see.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Your friend?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
I've been told that before.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
I'm not sewing anything else.
No!
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
Yes.  Later.
You loved him.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Does he have to go?
What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
A bit of one.
I'm feeling old.
This is making me incredibly angry.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
I don't think so.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
It's sold.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
Well, no...but...
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
That's my girl.
I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
Look on the back. What do you see?
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
Got it.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
Good morning.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
It was a long time ago.
One more item--not on the check list.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
I've got something for you.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Got it.
Yes. Yes.
A billion dollars.
Everything.
Transfer.
Where the money is.
A parting gift from the Empire.
We're doing it tonight.
Feeling old?
Can't be too careful.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
I sincerely hope not.
You gave them the eight billion.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
This is big enough.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
We're supposed to.
I figured that out.
Yes it does.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
You're a lawyer?
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
Five million dollars.
Yup.
Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
Excuse me?
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
What, you think I'm made of money?
That's crazy -- why not?
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Not in my world.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
That's right.
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Nope.  Maiden.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Have you been to the water board?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
It happens all the time.
In the conference --
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
We'll see.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
You got more than one?
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Thanks for reminding me.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
What?  But you been working so hard --
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
I'm just saying --
How would you know?
Nothing.
What do you want, a joke?
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
Have you been logging on?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
What?
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
The Emperor?
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
You know the Jedi Master?
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
What is it?
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
I'm going to see what it is.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
I take it back.
Now you're making sense.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
The entrance is collapsing!
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Here ... near the Anoat system.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Can you trust him?
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
Thanks.
You're part of the mining guild then?
We have no use for your kind.
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
I understand.
What is it?
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Well, what now?
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
What are you talking about?
I've never seen it fail.
I thought I was in good shape.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
That is why you fail.
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
They're...pretending to dress.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
We'll see.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
What's in it for me?
Not anymore.
I got a new deal for you.
I see your point. What's the favor?
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
Somebody get off!
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
I'm here.
Yeah, I got it.
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Don't like it, don't come.
If he lets you get close enough.
Who?
Are you crazy?
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
I cannot--
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Speak of the devil!...
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
That's not why you came.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Your mother told you that?
So be it.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
--Nothing!
I will run.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
Can it truly be used for magic?
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
I am the desert, where water disappears--
One land, one king! That is my peace!
You didn't ask!
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Fuck it.
I didn't know that.
Yes.
I see, your excellency.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Oh great, anything else?
I can't believe it.
Storage.
No. Not at all,
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
She is going to be well?
What man?
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Sure did.
No.
The priest.
Could you see her?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
What?
Um........Stuff.
Yeah.
Well you know it's okay.
You like him.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Do you not like him like daddy?
I don't know, I just thought.
How do you know?
Why does God let us get tired?
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
Honey it's to help you.
That's good.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Sure.
Who's in it?
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
In here. With us.
Intensely.
It would bring us together.
You and us.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Who are you?
How's your leg?
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
In the face of the enemy.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
Amen
And let my cry come unto thee.
Only what I read in the papers.
Yeah, a fall.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Just a minute.
Why not?
You're not going to drive!
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Your pay.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Baker.
Teeth.
Get your hand off me.
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
Out.
My pleasure.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Like an angel.
I hate your kids, Frank.
Try the black Knable.
Why the interest?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
Let's get it over with.
Come on, stand still.
So what do you think?
Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
Okay.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
February?
You always threw up.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
The tenth's out.
No.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
What're you doing?
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Spur of the moment.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
All right.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Blanche.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
We're finished.
Don't take it personally.
We ran long.
When we know.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
Where's my name?
What's wrong with it?
Hey!
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Big feet.
Uh... good.
Right.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Virgins.
First times. Hey, look at this.
He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
Great.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
I'll call you.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
For a while.  She left.
Not for money. With my mother.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
You want me to walk you?
Nothing personal --
Every year.
I guess in case one year they're not.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Who's Nina?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Huh?
He called her.
So, what happened?
We outgrew each other.
You don't pick your brother.
Hi.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
Is that what you used to do?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Why not?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Fine.  You?
Huh? Oh, no.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
Let me have a look.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
Something good?
Must've been after we got engaged.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Would it?
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Pollux is -- what?
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
You mean like ... condoms?
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
You can't blame me for trying.
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
No problem.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
So you left her?  Just like that?
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They’re all panicked here...
Is that tonight?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
What about me?
Seven.  Really.
But I think I like you better this way...
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Big Ed’s.
Like what?
I don’t think so.
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She wants to have an affair with me.
Pretty much.
It’s your birthday? Today?  What’s your name?  Where were you born?
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
No.
Me?
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
Give me my goddamn life back!
How much time?!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now what’s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let’s talk turkey!  How much money...?
Why not?
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
Get out, I call 911.
Are we what, Jack?
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
Yeah...fine.
Look, you don’t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
No, she’s not.
That is the general idea, yes...
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
It’s an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  I’m gonna buy it...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
Sorry, Jack.  It’s too important to me.
I want it...
It’s good, right?
Zeena...
I’ll fix it.  I’ll go out right now and get you something.  I’ll make it right.
Worse, you mean...
And now...?
That’s a big one for me, too.
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
But I’ve done some good things too, haven’t I?
Promise me again...
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Do I know you?
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
Okay, I’ll take them...
Is there anything I can do for you?
I’m sorry, no...
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I like the sound of that.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Ben.  Are you okay?
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Got it, teach.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
I'm worried about you.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Ben!  Ben!
Ben, are you there?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
So are you!
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Hilarious.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
What in the world would give me that idea?
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
Of course.  Of course.
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Just <u>find</u> him.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
Phase Two.
The less time, the better.
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
But big enough for us...
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
We're pushing oxygen today.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
You may learn to like it.
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
Oxygenation...
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
If there's any chance --
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
That line was tampered with...
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Two in a row?
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
I'm married.
Sort of.
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
Looks simple to operate.
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
May I have your ticket, please?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Certainly -
...What're you talking about?
We split that.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
What the heck d'ya mean?
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
...The heck d'ya mean?
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
Oh, yah, I know that!
Where'd you get him that parka?
Uh-huh - in what way?
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
In what way?
Can you be any more specific?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
And what about the other fella?
Yah, that can happen.
Uh-huh.
Oh, man!
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Yah, right -
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
You bet.
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Know who this is?
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Ya got the car?
Yah.
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
2:30.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
Ah, dammit!
...There's a million dollars here!
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Nope.
Yah.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Yah?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
No, no, that's fine.
I'm sorry, Mike.
I always liked ya so much...
Nope.
Margie Olmstead?
No.
The day of our homicides.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah?
Oh, fine.
Yah.
Yah.
It's terrific!
That's terrific.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
Right, right.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Really, what's that?
Some of it, yes.
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
What does that mean?
I'd like to thank the academy...
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
I don't know -- am I?
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
You can't have the whole brain!
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
So you're staying in tonight?
Good.
Do you care?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
Answer the question!
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What is wrong with you?
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
... You know me?
Yes... it's a test.
What?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Okay, everyone.
Pardon me?
What do you want me to do?
Being clever.
And, now it's gone.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Any historical figure.
I'm fine.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
It isn't... ?
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
Homework assignment.
Look...
I want to know --
... is over.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
Why do people think I'm you?
What are you talking about... ?
And, sometimes you control it...
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
What... what are you saying?
I'm going to...
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Not exactly according to plan.
Why what?
... no, no, no...
What have you left for me?
What?
What?
You told me you'd say that, too.
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
How'd you know?
Too much school.
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
I hope you're ready for this.
You were there?
Should we knock?
Random, sure.
That lucky bastard.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Take my van!
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Hold on.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
How do you know?
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
Who am I, David Blane?
Yeah?
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
Right. April 25th.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
No! No! Don't!
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
In Death...
No harm. No foul.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
No one's that strong.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Star Wars?
Start over.
Show me how it operates.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Powerful warrior.
Nothing we can do, man.
I suppose you have...
I thought he was with you.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
What?
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
Have fun.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
American.  Come to get you out.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
You threw him out?
Well, there's nobody special!
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Got any more bread crust?
No, I'm fine... really...
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
Thank you very much.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
Thanks.
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
How have you been?
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Fine.
I was nine in the sixties.
Yes.  They're free.
How much?
Tonight!  How's tonight?
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Sshhhh!
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
The Red Knight!
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Sure...
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
You advise us!
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
OWW...MAN...
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
Twinky?
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
You said.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
You're playing the other side.
No, dammit, I would easy.
You can sing the song.
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
Yes.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
No.
It brings out my eyes...
Palm Apodaca.
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
Who?
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Are you talking to us?
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Well, you seem very professional...
Hi, Tita.
That's good.
Don't, then.
Everybody still up on the Island?
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
Yeah, well, he's...
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
My turn.
Bye, Robert.
I guess you fell in the water.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
The day after tomorrow.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
That's right.
I'll be back later...
Oh. You have to tell me that.
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Hold onto this.
Well, she was.
Yes.
Then don't go out with me.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Just get the fuck outta here.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Victor.
Hi.
You got a boyfriend?
I did.
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
She fucks it all up!
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
How old is he?
She didn't say she had no man.
Positive.
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
I have no idea.
Not luck. They don't want me.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Yes.
Funny old bird.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Breathe easy...
Like tonight.
You don't know me.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
What?
Nothing. They're still there.
I'm fine.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Wait a second --
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Well, I'm fully covered.
Come on in.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Fletch?
What?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Why not?
Who?
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
You sure those doors will be open?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Don't say shoot, okay.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
You doing a story on this guy?
Cute thing.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
John! You used to fly together!
So were my parents.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Preoccupied with what?
I love the outfits.
Hi.
I ordered lunch.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Why did you do it?
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
Don't tell me I can't --
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Lock's busted.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
Moved out.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
Uh, almost.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
Why not? Oh shit... really?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
Utah?
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
You were going to can me, right?
Frieda's boss.
But I ain't got you...
Oh... I have some questions.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
But I am...
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
Ye-ah.
No, wait...
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Who's my real father, man?
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Fine!
I'm off it!
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Let me go out like a man.
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
Only on a first name basis.
It is to us!  It's computerised.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Doyle.
I'm clean.
Boca?
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
I wasn't looking.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Encore du sho ping!
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
What?
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
What's he do?
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Morning.  Sometime.
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
Let yourself in.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
Pour it in your ear.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Four.
Hiya, Jesus.
For garbage?
You remember Mary Finelli?
Yeah.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
You alright?
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I love you more.
I'm serious.
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
How's that?
Frank, please...
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
What?
I lost you.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
It did, Pop.  It did.
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
Tell me.
I'm glad.
She's not here.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
No.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
Hang on.
Better.
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Yeah.  That's it.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Sounds good.
So how are things at the hospital?
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
I hear that.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
You have the right to speak to an att --
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
Barely.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Why?
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
It's deceiving.
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
Sort of.
Maybe.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
Don't say any more.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Who's Horace?
Alright, alright.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Daddy, what is going on?
Okay.  There's one.
Come and get it.
Wait a minute. I just...
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
Huh?
Boy scouting.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
I've seen it.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
The what?
I'm here.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Not so bad, today.
N...nothing.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
For a good reason.
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Next, you dial a number.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Okay.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
And you'll never do it again.
Rennie's not coming.
It's...dead.
The fire alarm...
They're out of town.
What are you talking about?
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
There's something I haven't told you...
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
Please, hurry...
Very bad today.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Shut up, Elliot.
It's over, finished and done with.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
Do not inhale.
No, we're not.
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
She was very evasive.
Unbelievable.
This could be it.
This could be it.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Everything.
Daddy, wait.
It's only our first date.
Packs an emotional wallop.
A flat-out hit.
Mystery. Deception.
Yes.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
All right. What's been going on?
That's very lovely actually.
It violates so many trusts.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
Life is real.
I'm at the door.
It's me. Nicky.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
That's a simple subject.
What am I doing?
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
Life is good.
Because faith is rewarded.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
You're not making sense.
What color?
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
What?
Alla puttanesca.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Is what true?
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
Yes.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
I haven't come to you.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
Stop!
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I thought you were a man of God.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
He said he's in charge...
I thought you were against fighting.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
You will respect the law.
Even as a boy I thought so.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
I --
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
That was England.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
Thank you. No.
I dined at the prison.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
It's for the best.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
A man's dead, Detective.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Blood.  From the vein.
Something's not right.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Luca could still be an accomplice.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Jerome--?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
The Mission Director.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
You know I'm scared of heights.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
You may as well invite her here.
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
German, is that you?
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
Why not?
You worried about the cost?
No.
Why would we do that?
In the South Wing.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You'll be next.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Come on.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
I can't do this.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
Stay clean.
Beynon.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
I want to take a walk.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Better than old times.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Assumed name... Houston.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Just the way I remembered.
Better than I remembered.
Suit yourself.
Is he straight?
For exits off Main Street.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
At least you were outside.
Bullshit.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
Fifteen minutes.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
I mean it.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
El Paso.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
Twenty eight hundred.
Not now.
No scars.
I don't see how.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Yeah... I guess it does.
No, I'm afraid not.
Oh my God.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Might try that.
Where?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Not now.
That right?
I Just want to find a suitcase.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
I'll tell you when.
When did you find out?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Yeah.
What about?
Why?
Christ, what...
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
I can't Jack. How can I?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
He was all right to me.
Yes.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Who?
Really?
While he was here. You went about together?
So where are we going, Princess?
Nasty.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Now you're asking.
Especially when I play the lead.
Yeah.
Your brother? What you talking about?
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
Working at Woolworths.
What?
Why would it?
Right.
Large Scotch.
Good lad.
How many?
How'd you find me?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
You sure?
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
No, you won't.
Don't ask me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
How'd you know I wouldn't?
Not much.
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
How could I stay away?
No, I didn't know that.
It would be. If they were still living.
Making a living.
Can't say I do.
Piss off, Ray.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
No.
They killed the goose.
You get a bad month, all of a...
Some contest board...
No.
Nurses.
He is?
What?
What?
That's the truth...
You...
They...
When they...
What?
Someone should hurt them.
Yes.
As a robbery.
Did you talk to Graff?
He would take you on.  Yes.
That's right.
So I'm making it concrete.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
What?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
No.
I was at home, where were you?
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
You think so?
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
No.
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
Just go to lunch.
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Get in the goddamn room.
...then...
Moss.
...after the thirtieth...
Murray...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
You know what those leads cost?
Murray said...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
Either way.  You're out.
The leads are assigned randomly...
And what if you don't close.
Twenty percent.
And fifty bucks a lead.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
Somebody broke in.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
What?
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
I'm sorry.
Because I don't like you.
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
That's right.
Last night, this morning.
From the store.
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
What is it?
Oh!  For the magazine...
Kenilworth.
I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Did I...?
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I'm not.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
The power to negotiate.
She told me not to talk to you.
Guess who?
I'm going home.
Yes.
If you don't want it, give it back.
Three.
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
No, where is it?
To do business.
I'm not hungry.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
No, Dad.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
It was hard to have him killed.
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
What's that?
But, you told me yourself...
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
And you believed that story.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
 And he agreed?
Chi?
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Yes.
I don't know.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Mike, at three and a half...
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
Not for a few years.
Yes.
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
No, I'm fine.
So?
No.
I do not.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
They feel cheated.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
No, she's here.
We worked it all out beforehand.
The same assurance we got from you.
What about Michael Corleone?
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
Yes.
I won't keep you another minute...
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Expect nothing fancy.
He is dead now, twenty years.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
A homo?
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Nice place.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
What did she mean by going flooey?
Huh?
It's new.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
Your family ate dripping?
Go ahead.
This David's a friend?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
Not me.
You're talking through your hat now.
No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
No harm done.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Run for what?
Catch my death.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
Never gave it much thought.
A very lucky thing indeed.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
What happened?
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
What won't do?
There are straps in back.
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
You're crazy.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Pray you, undo this button.
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
I think I'll hang around.
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
So what do I do?
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Of course.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Luminal.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
I guess.
Six years ...
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
What for?
How's Atley -- ?
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
You know my back.
Needs brightening ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Not at all ...
Good.
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Peugot convertible ...
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
It's arright ...
That's a good one, Donny...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
Remember who my brother is?
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
You've been pre-booked...
Yeah... You want a ride...
Don't go there, Toby --
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Okay --
What do you got ... ?
I can handle it --
Me...
The era when crime didn't pay --
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
Nah.
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
Sure, man --
No problem -
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
Now, we go -
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
No way ...
No ...
Deodorant.
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Woo-woo-wooooo!
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
And the moral of that story is -- ?
No we don't -
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Not really -
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Nods again.
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
How much?
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Jezuz Christ!
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
With what?
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
Just get me out.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
Jimmy.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
How?
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
He's with his friends.
I don't want them left back.
What? Come on!
Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat--
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Ah, history I think.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
This is your house, right?
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
You could put a pool in that backyard.
Yah, all right...
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
I'm Irish.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
History.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
--But--
Hey fuck you.
Really?
It's an integer proof.
I don't know what it's called.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, cured polio.
I did.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
I got your card.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
It's on the college.
I'll be okay.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
I won't talk first.
Not at all.
I been here a couple years.
I think so.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Who?
Now wait a minute--
"Undermine?"
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
He's not you!
Me too.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Hold up.
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
Have you read all these books, Will?
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
I don't know.
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
Yeah.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
You're not going to fail me are you?
Cause fuck him, that's why.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
I'm Will.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Yes you were.
Your house must have been a zoo.
We'll do that.
No.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
Fine.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
So, do you play the piano?
No.
What?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
I'm not honest?
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
Goodbye.
How 'bout you?
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Now I can't breathe.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
But--but how we gonna eat?
Which way is House 25?
Joad. Tom Joad.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
An' you say no cops?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
Take her with you!
California.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
I'm ready.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
They killed Casy first.
They know what--this fella looks like?
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
He was a good man.
But who done it?
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
I wisht it was day.
Man bones?
Won't they ketch us?
Now don't you go monk'ing--
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yes I do.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's what I do.
You could've been a contender, huh?
What do you want to do?
It's nice to see you again.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Bad experiences.
Bad television.
What's that?
That'd be good.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Jesus Christ!
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
I'm staying here.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Out Loud?
You understand the psychology of the job.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
He using her.
One cannot love and kill.
No...
All of it?
Never enough.
It's a place where religious people--
I have a headache. You have a headache?
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
How did you find out all that?
Huh?
Tom.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
Why?
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
Fine!
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
I didn't know I had to.
I don't care.
What?
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Don't they believe in signs here?
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
My period.
That's not true.
What?
Go ahead...
Exactly...
Hi.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
Why?!
She will if you think she should.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Everything all right.
About what?
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
No. He had the choice.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
You!
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Weekend after next...
We should be fine, then.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
I don't know if I can.
I know where he goes.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
I want to watch.
So?
Maybe... look -- just...
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
Oh yeah...
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
It's cool!
Don't move!
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Difficulty rating?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Go fix the phones.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Burn!
What's this one eat?
We did it!
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
You're not gonna win.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
I know, I know who wrote it.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
It's my subway defense system.
Yeah.
Dreams?
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Homicidal?
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
My name is the Plague.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Nonono, thank YOU!
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
No, you don't understand.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
No. You son of a bitch!
Brady! Come with us.
Brady!
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
How do you know their not?
How many people in the bus?
How many bodies did you find?
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
Outside.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
No way. No how.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
No.
I can't.
Why?
Jamie?
The state police won't know how to stop him.
No problem, Sheriff.
Dear God.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Fun-ny. See you.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Okay. Bye.
He can still watch.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Come with me.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
And I can't keep you interested?
Yeah.
Will you call me tomorrow?
I'll be here.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
I found the car! He's here!
I don't think so...
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
I promise.
I'm scared...
Was it the bogyman?
Let's make more popcorn.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
You're coming with us...
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
Come in, come in.
Oh, listen...
Mmm?
I can't believe it!
Well, let's hope so.
You want to see some?
Mmm.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
And it ruins everything else.
Oh, okay.
This time I really think I have something.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
When did you first notice this?
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
I don't know exactly.
What are you doing here?
Ohhhh!
Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Yes?
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
I have been in love with you for so long.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
What do you expect me to say?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
I can't say anything!
I almost didn't.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
Aren't they great?
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Are you in love with someone else?
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
No.
Leave me alone, can you?!
Get his wine away.
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
No, thank you.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
Oh, Frederick!
I can't take this anymore.
No.
I'm sorry.
But not you.
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
Oh...
Oh, now-- 
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Football!
No, no, we decided!
Oh, sure.
Yeah.
She really does, though.
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Oooo.
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Look, everything's going your way.
Yeah, that's clerical.
Hmm!
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
I remember you.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Oh, no.
Yeah, it was.
Come on.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
Mmm, what?
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Hmm.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Take our literature...
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
I'm going to tell you later....
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
I <u>swear</u> to you...
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Now, whyn't you help us?
Say it in English.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
Then I'm doing fine.
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
Yeah, so where is he?
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Exactly.
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
....what...? 
...what's he got against you?
You seen John Brigham...?
I think its meaning is clear.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Said what?
I said sometime it gets so...
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
...your <u>scar</u>..?
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
And how did he do that?
...but will that satisfy you?
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
....because we don't have any mmm...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
What shape is the scar?
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
I know it well.
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.

I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
Ronnie!
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
King David.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
Give me the clipboard.
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
I don't really like your friends either.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.

"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
Did not.

But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
playfully shoves his hand away.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
Love, you can still write to each other.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
hurries over.
Thank you so much!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
gives her a sympathetic look.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
It doesn't matter.
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
You're such an incredible woman.
That idiot boarder?
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
You mean travel by ourselves?
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Your insight is enlightening.
The way you just looked at me...
Second most common?
I understand, I think. Other women?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
I said she's been missing for-
What's that?
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
This isn't happening.
In a word? Lucrative.
Really, why's that?
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
Where's my wife?
No please make yourself at home.
A little? Try unbelievably.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
Try stupid.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Allen?  He... he's okay?
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Mister LaPlante...
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
Me!
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
Lie, you mean...
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
What picture?
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
JOEY!
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
You're sitting on your ticket.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
What about a reward for coming forward?
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
You didn't?
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
Whoa, check it out.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Yeah, that was easy.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
It's a living.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
I think we should talk first.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
A man scared me.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
He'll never appreciate it more.
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Stop knowing me so well.
What?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
No.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Fuck you, Philip.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
What about cable?
I didn't.
And I can't help having a cold.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Even cosier.
No joke, Lieutenant.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
They appear to be authentic.
Yes.
What is it?
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
I think it was England.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
Lieutenant.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
Is that it?
Aye.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Who are you?
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
How long is the voyage?
She's the King's cousin.
I think you just like to eat dirt.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
The past?
Aye.
What do you want?
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
You got me.
Because it's my name.
I don't know anymore.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
You're twenty minutes late.
I've lived all over the world.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
I like my work.
We'll see.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
I'll no forget you.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
My dreams died long ago.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
I think he's dead!
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
I understand.
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
What?
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Okay.
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
I got the gasoline --
I overheard him with the girl.
It won't be a problem.
What do you mean?
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
Where is it?
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
Just one question.  Please.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
You have her cell number?
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
What?
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Who is it?
No!  They're right here --
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
Your phony FBI assholes.
I don't have that much.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Where is she?
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
The front gate would be best, General.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
Get in.
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Fuck you.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
I saw the sign.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
He wants your wisdom.
We must do something.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Murdered! By whom?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
What for Paul.
You cannot go alone.
In Ruhengeri?
Yes.
Why?
Tell me what it was.
Please do not talk like this.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
The lieutenant wants the register.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Many beers.
The staff, the guests.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Where?
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
Not at all!
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
Yeah...something.
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
C'mon.
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
I don't know!!
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Yeah, me too.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
Did it work?
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
What?
It's not going to let us out!
Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.
I'm better than that.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
It'll have to do.
He's dead...?
-- was that??
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
Asking the wrong person again.
Question answered.
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
No, no, it's just --
My wife. Where were we?
And then what happens?
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
Maybe if I --
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Something with the power, I don't know!!
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
I never saw you --
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
-- no more --
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
Believe me, we need to.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
What's the matter?
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
No!
A few years older, perhaps.
I'm sorry.
Good-bye.
That poor little girl.
Well I bet you they're happy.
No it won't - no it won't!
Ok...
My God, I heard something!
He's blessing the house.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
That's great, honey.
Daddy help!
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
To our family.
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
What about keeping an open mind?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
Should I...
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
Before.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
Did you know her very well?
What!
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
And you...are?
Good night.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
The amulet...
What are you getting at!
Oh.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
And what did you discover?
Then tell me what to do.
So where is it?
Where?
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Right.  Right!
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I'll do it!
Who's that?
And he still sits there?
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Buying some drugs, alright?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
I'm sorry.
Fuck you!
Really?
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Something like that.
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
Rutherford Auction... that name...
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Let's just forget it, I mean...
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Yeah.  The big E.
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Oh.  Well, what's this?
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Actually he never told us what it was.
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
Baseball, why?
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
What job?
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Well, maybe I --
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
He didn't offer you money.
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
...I'm sorry.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Phony, huh?
Terrific.
I'm sure you do.
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
This I know, Benny.
But, buddy --
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Norville.
Yeah?
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
Wait a minute!
Get out of my sight.
Oh my God, sir!
Oh my God, sir!
There's one in every story.
He notices.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
That's nonsense, Alma.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
But you didn't have to come up here.
Thank you.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
Is she a doctor?
I like her already.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
You can't really believe that.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
I am not a frightened girl.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Of course not!
And charming?
Good morning.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
I love Fort Holland.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
So early?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
You go dry off now.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
You think I --
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Ben.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
Birth control.
What?
Good night kiddo.
Jesus all right enough!
What do you think we're doing, dad?
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Well, we can talk about it.
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Nobody.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
Social work?
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
But not too ashamed.
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
Um, Libbets Casey.
Am I right or am I right?
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Out.
Tell Sandy? What?
I don't know.
Wendy!
Huh?
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Can I come?
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
What are you doing?
Are you his girlfriend?
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Then change it.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Why?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
What time was that?
I told her to come.
What?
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
That's right.
Seven years.
You know what about.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
Huh?
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
The other guy?
After that she left the party to go to him.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Thought you wanted something fun...
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
You don't know.
Who?
The phone call.  The knapsack.
But you wanted to.
Yes.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Surely you know the one who made you...
Then God does not exist...
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
She is.
We can do that?
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
Does it?
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
He jests.
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Still my beautiful child.
Yes.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
Love?
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
Yes...
But if she dies...
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
I want it!
I can't do it.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
The crucifix -
Do you think so?
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
Are you mad????
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
No...
What the hell would you call this?
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Some.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Can't what?
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
I don't know.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
How much?
Not anymore.
No. I shot him.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
Must have missed the sign.
She's in her room.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
They were gore before I came here.
No.  She shall not be left here.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
I think not.
Thea is an orphan.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now —- I don't know ——
That should decide it or you --
How do you know what my father thought - -
You wouldn't tell that ——
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Her name is Thea?
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt —— after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
But that should make you like her.
We have no time for that.
But the war, the army —— they need you.
You are my friend.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
I can't.
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Then foreclose!
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Yeah, very funny.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Our clothes are dry.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
No, of course not.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Where is she?
Well, naturally. Of course.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
That's the kid.
Well, wait and see.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
They went out of business years ago.
Thanks.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Of course it's the place.
Well, what happened to you?
Want to give my flower a drink.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
No charge.
Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
I'm all right.
Came back three days ago.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Hmmm?
No.
Yes –– charge.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Hope you enjoy it.
Okay.  What's yours?
Oh . . .
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
What's that?
Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Hello, Violet.
It's important.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
This way.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
All right, sir.
I'll take chocolate.
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
You may kiss my hand.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Didn't you tell her?
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
Would you rather leave?
Don't you like her?
That does it –– come here.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Thanks for dropping around.
Hi.
Left them at the office.
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
I don't care. It's George's tux.
What plates?
Hmm? Well, I . . .
How fast is enough?
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Swim for it!
Is she responsible for the punch?
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
You're betting what you already got.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Anyone got another set of sails?
Can you get us a line?
No!  It's still there!
It's still there!
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
You can't stop me.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Not till next year.
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Sean's still out there.
Did you get any pictures?
Too late, it's written.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
Is there one in these waters?
Fooling around?
As far as the office.
What're you guys doing today?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
Nothing, huh?
Terrific.
Just one minute....
Going out.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
We have to do something.
I know, I know....
It's still a good idea.
That's it?
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
That's you.
Now I really want to see it.
Shh.  Shhh....
Help!  Help!
Nope.
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
Huh?
Just like this.
Mike?  Our Mike?
Anything?
What the hell is it?
Power line.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Might as well.
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
Yeah.
He thought he had a good reason.
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
Yeah.  Down there.
Hope I make it through both.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Honey, I gotta go.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
Get out of here!
That's a lot of ground to cover.
Nothing.
That we swim.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Up.
I talked you into this?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
Yes.
What's that?
No.
No, you're not.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
How's your patient?
What's up?
Okay.
No,  I'm not going through there.
Well, that's why you got it.
I have to get out of here.
I don't understand.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... Okay.
Who's going to do it?
Michael, you're not going down there.
But you --
I'm  fine.
Make this quick!
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I thought they were clever.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
So do I, love.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Still sleeping.
Why are you?
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
Don't blame yourself.
He's missing.
Sure.  No problem.
Yeah, from Boston.
I don't know, it depends.
Are you really?
Come on!  Check this out!
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Why you sonuvabitch...
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Can hardly wait to do it again.
It's okay, Sean.
That?
It's disappeared.
Calvin said it was all right.
Buzz off.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
It's large enough...
It's not closing, Mike.
He needs a haircut.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Something wrong?
Don't hurry back.
But you always let me....
Yes, I did.
No way....
We forgot to stop at the store.
Then don't come any closer.
What's wrong?  What happened?
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
I don't know....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
He heard that.
Thank you....
You guys must be starving....
I'm fine....
I'm not going to quit now....
I am.
You're not a pain in the ass....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
Where do I pull off...?
A big one....
No!
What?
I have coffee in the thermos.
You're the man who drives the plane.
Yes I can....
Get her started....
Aye, aye, Captain....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
We'll be done pretty soon....
Feathers all over the place....
Will you leave me alone...?
The readings suck....
Put me down, damnit....
When we got the grant....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
As long as he's been here....
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
Maybe it's gone....
I'm going down, Jake....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
You don't like my voice...?
Screw you, Jake....
I told you....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
What?
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
The <u>dogs</u>?
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
It's a method for quitting smoking.
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
You want me to stop the car?
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
You don't really believe this?
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
Hey ..
I guess by the bed.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
You ain't going in alone?
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
No.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Once.
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Bullshit.
My hands?
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
It was probably the wind.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
Do you pray?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
Why does he want to kill me?
Then why didn't he kill me?
The man from the F.B.I.
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
I know about the bachelor party.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
-- stop --
There is something missing here.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
I just got goosebumps.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Sure.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Oh good.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Same to you.
Oh hell yes.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
What --
...my soul or something. _ 117.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
Of course, medical! _ 42.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Huh?
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
Great word.  Towel?
Fine.
Forget it.  Forget it.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
What --
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
How sad --
Not a chance.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
-- and I'll get 'em.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
What is it?
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
What's a bad idea?
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Eric...
That one time was just the bumper.
Think.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
How low?
Here!
Just hold on.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
A well-accepted theory.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
Are you sure?
No. I couldn't see.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
I have never been on this island!
Just a little bit too much, I think.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
Everyone, keep your voices down!
I want to see the nesting ground!
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
I don't even know this woman.
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Why?
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Oh, God.
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
You're going too?
Oh, my God.
It has a broken leg!
Look!  Sarah!
Why did you come here?
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Funded by whom?
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
What?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
I believe in him.
Where's Ian?
Can the kid walk?
What now?
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Shhhhh!
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
Six weeks?
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
John....
Why?
Look.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
Small versions of adults, honey.
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
We were right!
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
They're not here.
Hola, bienvenido
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Thank you.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
That's a good idea.
You got me.
Try to!
You have no idea.
Why?
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Wu?
What does he mean by "target audience"?
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
It's safe.
Dorkatops!
I'll stay awake.
You're a beautiful big animal.
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Excellent.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
I really think we should go back...
What about that other guy?
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
That's my job.
_Krueger_...
Compared to this guy... amateur.
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
Who's chest?
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
None of that's true?
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
So what do we do?
Not yet.
How's that possible?
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
What is it really?
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
-- Small.
-- In what sense?
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
In a manner of speaking.
Yes.
Another one?
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
I do.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
He was murdered.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
-- Listen to me --
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
Yes.  Isn't it there?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
Oskar.
And we're upset too.
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
I photographed it extensively, father.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Value? ... Value?
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
An ape ... some kind of ape.
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
Don't belong?
Sorry. 
Didn't want you.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Like for you to look for the man.
-- Yes.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
I said yes, I see.
My name's John Klute.
Mm.
Could I ask some questions?
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
-- OK --
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
What do you think?
Well, let's go down and ask him.
Yeah, you got to me.
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
What am I supposed to say?
Don't touch anything.
OK.
I believed her, Pete.
I better keep looking.
How is it back there?
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
I wanted to give it to you first.
Two years ago? Sorry.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
Did she talk about him to you?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Yeah.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
Nobody's seen that.
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
He's in his room, playing.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
What about your mommy?
Lunch in a restaurant.
Playing.
On earth.
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Mom, I mean dad?
I guess...
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
You mean for good?
Oh...
I love you...
Sure.
Sure.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Where will my toys be?
I do not, your honor, however--
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Objection!
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
Objection!
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
Such as?
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
I don't believe you.
Murray.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
I'm going to take it.
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
I know....I know.
Fine.
Six.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
No.
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What?
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
Ted, I just heard...
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Yes, Holiness.
Khambas are wild men.
Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
No cried?
And you have horses? You love horses.
Here. We'll collect them.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
I have.
Soon.
We did not.
All?
Time to study.
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
I accept it. What is suffering?
Please.
I do not know, Holiness.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
When it is time.
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Britain?
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
I had relinquished doubt.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
Thank you.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Ahh.
It is possible, Holiness.
What would you do, Holiness?
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
Oh, yes.
No.  Do you?
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
Mr. Cyr!
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
Cocktail?
No!!  Out!
And you like me.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
So profound and fat.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
Bastard bit my chopper.
You ready on shore?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
Guess I finally got bit.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Who?
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
I beg your pardon?
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
You <u>did</u>, you--
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Good idea.
He heeds a tourniquet.
Yeah.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
White perch.
So does he.
Did he say anything?
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
You like Jack?
Yes.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
Else.
It's ten after nine.
A tooth?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
Shitbutt?
Why not?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Where?
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Not yet.
And what is that, sir?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Not lately. But maybe someday.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
How many women has he used, our Bill?
All flayed...?
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
I never thought about it.
I don't know. Is it?
Who killed your patient?
Was it a butterfly?
Killed outright?
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
How long did you live there?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
All right, then tell me how -
Yes...! They were screaming.
Yes...
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
Did you breast-feed her?
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Why did they turn back?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Miss.  May I?
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
We don't.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
Fire!!!
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
Yes.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
France.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
What has?
He did.
Crunch...Implosion.
Just get in yours!
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
Good...It's going good.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
I can't see them!
What's your air reading?
And it killed Bo?
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
Beautiful.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Not yet.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Russian.
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Right.
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
I'll think of something, don't worry.
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
You get the guns?
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
All right, Dad.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Furry muff, let's go.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
He means they're thieving dogs.
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
I'11 meet you in the car.
I'll only be a minute.
You will what?
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
For half a million?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
Seven hundred each.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
How the fuck should I know?
What do you mean?
Oh, come on, Amado--
Leave your sister out of it.
They're not going to jail.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
They stole our land--
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
I-I can do the job, sir.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
The--the officers.
No, sir. Not at all.
He'll live.
Sergeant?
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Yeah.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
So that's him--
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
He a Black man or an Indian?
They fought against the Indians?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
He's still pissed off about it.
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
You lived in the States for a while?
It's a lead mine.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Pleased to meet you.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
Substance abuse?
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
That's right.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Bandidos, Injuns--
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
He was a unique individual.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Seems like we have another one every week.
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
I don't mean Fernando.
I never said that. It was just that boy--
It's Saturday.
How much you got left?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
Amado.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
Yeah.
I came back 'cause you were here.
Yeah--
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
I appreciate you telling me.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
What's up?
You sell much out here?
Hell of a spot to put a business.
You know who it was?
Name's Otis.
Runnin' numbers illegal.
You going to tell him?
Who?
Nix?
How?
A Nix specialty?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Right.
All right.  It was...
What do you mean, "all of us?"
Why did you wait so long?
What is he?
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
Harry.
When do you want me to start?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
That's my business. Harry.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
I told you --
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
Quaid and Jennifer--
It's okay.
I'm here, Harry.
Yes.
Good.  There.  Yes?
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
What about Swann's miracles?
Oh, I've got plenty.
Mr. D'Amour?
Mine.
Swann's wife.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
No.
I tried to pay you off.
Shit...
We've got to get you to a hospital.
I won't say anything.
What?
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Yes...
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Didn't know you read minds.
Is that all?
In my time, and nobody else's.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
I don't know.
A couple of weeks.
No!
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Two years.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
No.
I know. I don't either.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, I was looking at you.
No, yes, it does...
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
Yeah, look at that thing.
Tomorrow.
That's what you said the other night.
Hello, darling.
That sounds great — can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Bob?
What?
Do you want to- 
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
That's ok.
Bye.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
I gotta go to work.
Bye.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
It'll just be a few days.
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
It's probably trivial.
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
Must be a spare set.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
And how would you describe him?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
It's nothing.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Just open the door, please.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Miette, come here and relax.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Kelson, hold on a second...
I think you gave me the wrong one.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
I had to.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
What's the bible for?
What are these?
What did he say to you in French?
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
I know who he is.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
You are the younger of two...
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
We millionaires yet?
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Where is she now?
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
Need any help?
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
Really?  Well, come on, then.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Then I'll get you some punch.
It's okay.
To do what you love.
Too many times.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
What?
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
I was just playing ball.
Just one word of advice for next season.
What's up, Sidra.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Just like that?
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
So that means I have to ride with you.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
God, here we go.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Yeah.
You either.
Hey.
He ain't Spalding.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Why not?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
Uh huh.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Kiss my ass.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
What do you mean?
No.
Maybe go back to school.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Find.
We need to talk.
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
Then why are you so upset?
Hey.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Well, can you give him this for me?
Business folks.
At one in the morning?
Nona, please.
Uh, your earring?
What are you doing in my room?
Okay.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Yup.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Sorry.  You okay?
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
We need to talk.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
What?
Came by to check on you.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
In my sleep, Burt.
What's wrong?
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
baby, please, please --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
GET OUT.
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
You don't have a boyfriend?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
It's not -- what's a 422?
You won't.  You won't have to.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
You wanna go on a date with me?
Well...is that illegal?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
I've got troubles.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
You mind if I come in, check things?
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
How much time do we have?
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
That's confidential information, little man.
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
I was listening --
What's up?
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
Might of been before my time.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
-- Samuel Johnson.
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Mmm.Hmm.
Stay that way.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Don't do this, Don.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
Do you wanna sit down?
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
She loves you.
When was the last time you talked to your son?
I've seen it before.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Go fuck myself?
It's ok.
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
Like I said, yeah --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
Yes.
What am I doing?
From '84 to '89.
...this close...
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
I'm really sorry.
Yeah.
Mmm.
yeah.
Calm down.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
No one else in here?
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
Rose, I don't --
No one else that I know?
What about now?
Well maybe.
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I'm not through asking my questions.
I don't know.
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Are you her boyfriend?
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
No they don't --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
You need to sober up.
Shut the fuck up.
What are you doing?
Hang up the phone.
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
mmmhmm.
Yeah.
Yes. What? Yes.
That's pretty cool.
You're late, not me.
I'm fine. nothing.
Stand up.
Hi.
Yes.
I have money to give you.
This happens....this is something that happens.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
I wish to discuss your brother.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
You're a fool!
So what has changed?
You can't do it.
Everyone back.
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
Why didn't you say so?
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
Who?
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
I know.
The King killed my son!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
She will be at the ball.
D'Artagnan...
Just... water.
Phillippe.  Rest now.
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
Thank you, your Majesty.
Yes, your Majesty.
... You knew you had a double?
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
There.
I am unhurt --
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
You would do that, your Majesty?
Oh Louis, Louis...
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Alright, stay on the phone.
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
It wasn't in the cards.
Up north.
Yeah.
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
Please...
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
Both at the same bank...
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
That's when it happened?
Could he handle a direct contact?
How are Molly and the boy?
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Not the Bible?
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
I am all right.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
No other possibilities?
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
What's it narrow down to?
There's no connection between the families.
What?
He had to.
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
How far away's the back-up?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
It's a surprise.
You'll come by?
It's me.
Was I in an accident?
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes.
Oh, God.
Please, no.
God, no.
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
No.
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Thank you very much.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Cut the general crap.
That's true.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
What's average?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
What did he want?
We have it good, don't we?
Tell me about yourself.
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
I have to see somebody.
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
My name's Will Graham. I...
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
I thought you would have some ideas.
You're insane.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I haven't decided yet.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
Fight what?
You got it.
Tank you veddy much.
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
What, you don't think I can beat him?
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
Yeah...
Twenty!
Deal.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Hi... am I late?
No thanks.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
You're a wimp.
What is this, World War Two...?
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
I'll take my chances!!
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
I used to think you were original.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
They're gonna lynch him!
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
Two grand.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
Hear what?
The Matrix isn't real!
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
... Yeah.
What happened to them?
How?
Are they any agent?
Go.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
You could say that.
What truth?
Far from it.
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
You've never used them before.
More important than what is when?
Show me.
What -- what lesson?
How?
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
What's going on?
Of the Resistance.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Yes, sir.
Honestly?  I don't know.
What?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
What is the Matrix?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
From you.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
I'm going in after him.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
Why?
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
They're hacking his mind.
Because I believe in something.
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Follow me.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Sounds good.
You sure?
Anybody wanna have a game?
'Thou art then a king?'
She don't look Jewish.
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
No, she isn't.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
Did you see them run!
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
No.
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
Hostess?
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Oh...around...why?
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
What was it?
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Sure...He lives there?
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
The girls like it loud.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Quiet please.
You ate?
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
No.
'Goddam party'!
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
But what?
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
You mean this, sir?
Right away.
What 'business'?
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Of whom?
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
What'd it say?
'Yes' to the deal?
Did you just hear something?
No no, not you.
Uh -- he's from out of town --
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
I don't care.
Yours.
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Make it time.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
She knows you real self?
Rass!
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Sure.
Didn't the family get together last night --?
What?
It's so very nice to see you again.
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
Love.
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
I'm sorry.
I haven't.
I don't have any.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Be sorry for nothing.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I said get out.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
It's a saying.
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
-- Yes?
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
I guess so.
Yes, Bill.
That's what everybody says.
I understand.
So can I.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
That's okay.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
Get him in here.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
You fill the bill, Bill.
Of course.
What?
I'm sorry, I --
It's enough now.
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
Quiet.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
Next week?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Hi, honey.
How did you know?
Probably.
You're not listening --
Don't get dirty, Dad --
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Bravo.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Yer damn right.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Then what will you say?
It's something.
I don't know.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
Where's he going?
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
That's why it's okay.
So you're a one-girl guy?
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
What's it like?
Just two. So far.							  *
Leonard.
Hi, Leonard.
Interested in buying one?
I forget.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
Take the money and walk away!
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Yes.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Yes.
Yeah. You?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Just relax.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
And what did he say?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Thank you.
What?
Well, that's me.
So why did you come here?
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
I'll be waiting.							   *
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Why are you following me?
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
It makes all the difference.					 *
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done.

Okay.  You got the "item"?
Two main players plus three.
25% discount on the load.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
Later!  Do you dance?
No.
Exactly.
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Do I need it?
Really?
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
No.
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
And what do I do with him?
'Cause she will tell you.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
Chill out Sonny.
What's the point?  It's going down.
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
Have faith.
Sonny...?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
Yeah.
Bored.
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
Yeah, oh yeah.
I ain't sleepy.
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Whatsa matter now?
What's that supposed to mean?
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
You like it? Take a look.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Yeah, well, so?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
Yeah.
They gotta be.
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
What?
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Yessir, I can see that.
Ready for anything.
Get down -- where?
Instant V-goddam-D.
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
Where?
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
We go through the wall?
KNOCK IT OFF!
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
Stop shitting me, man!
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
I'll pay extra
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Would you recognize him again?
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
Stupid.
Something like that. Cigarette?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
About as good as it looks.
What did he do?
Twelve years.
That doesn't seem so bad.
He wasn't even in the car?
How long?
Hello.
Where is it?
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
What?  You gotta be joking.
After we're outside the kogus?
I know where it is.
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Shit.
Right.
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
Oh, Jesus!!
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
I pull.
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Across both tracks!!
Please.
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Don't get kinky here...
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
It didn't bite me.
Toss the flare down!
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
That's it?
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
How long...?
Following me?
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
It has no nobility.
The phones are working?
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
The Sistine Chapel?
I know how that can be.
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
Show me the way?
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
I don't know.
Great.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
--not fair?
I can't write this anymore.
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Why would you lose me?
No, I haven't.
Three more chapters to go.
I'm almost done.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
Here it is.  Very first copy.
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
Sean, please..
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
How do you that.
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
'Thief in the Night?'
Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
Well, that's good, isn't?
Then don't say it.
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
It's that time.  Go.
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Ethan Hunt.
Which is?
So do I.  Sort of.
Damn, you're beautiful.
And six billion in the world.
Sean Ambrose, for one.
Can you think of a better one?
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Just about..
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
How do you suggest I go about it?
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
So what do you suggest?
I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Good idea.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Don't move.
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
You didn't have to.........
I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
Theyíre dead.
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I follow you.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Information.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
I'll get you close.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Bank?
We'll see.
We're not outta here yet.
Just don't chew it.
Why?
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
Can you lose him?
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
And get a doctor.
Keep counting Claire.
Jack...that's spying.
Twenty minutes.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Thank you, Rose.
Yes.
And go to confession.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
What's your news?
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
I won't come.
Maybe.
He did?
Let's go tell your Mother.
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
He's in Palermo.
Yes.
Instantaneous.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
You really are stupid, you know that.
Where are you taking me?
Get all of me. Take everything.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
That light.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
What did you do?
What?
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
For what?
It's the best thing there is.
Awful?
Yeah.
You're late!
Why?
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
No. I'm gonna wait.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Maybe you're right.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
A wife knows.
It was a miracle.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
Where is she?
That's incredible.
Good.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
I am alone in the world.
None of your business.
That woman was a student of yours?
Why do men chase women?
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
No.
Good night.
Is who down there?
What would he be doing down there?
You see that moon last night?
Oh. Right.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
...What?
Through ... We found them.
What do you mean?
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
I am your king!
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
NI!
You said it again!
So be it!
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
My liege,  I am honored.
Bedevere, my Liege.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
Just keep me covered.
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
Oh, just some friends!
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings King Arthur.
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
Be quiet!
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
What - the curtains?
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
I'm ... your son ...
Got it?
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
I don't think I was.
No, I'm not.
You got my note!
A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Seventy a year.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
Get out.  Out!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
Whom you address.
Out of my way!
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
It is quite late enough.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
My own.
We --
I beg your pardon?
There are important papers from --
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
Occasionally.
Why do you think I keep her here?
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
Ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
Archie.
Aye, ma'am.
What does he know about the Highlands?
To keep out the cold.
Yes, ma'am.
I do not accept.
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
Oh, several things.
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
No, ma'am.
Yes.
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
I hope he got his mother's permission.
To know when he'll be king.
You can't know that for sure.
Excellent!
Whom?
Cold is good!
The same, your Majesty.
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
A few days, ma'am.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
Why?
We were expecting you to return by six.
Again?
How do you stop The Screamer?
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
What the hell does that mean?
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
What?!
Nick, what is it.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
And beat it at it's own game.
Everything.
You didn't hear me?
Put in a quarter.
What?
Got it.
You've got the schematics, check.
Right, then...
Yeah, that's what worries me.
Check your read-out.
What?!  There's nothing here!
Screamer.
We don't have a choice!
I know.
Of course I am.
Yes...but...how did you...
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
Sign me up.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
No problem. What's on your mind?
Okay.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Well, I ...
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
I told ya.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Are you okay?
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
Oh...
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
I don't know who I am.
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
What do you mean?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
Do you know them?!
Keep going. Go around to the back.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
This Denny's.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Where at?
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I'm working on it.
I'm leaving.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Okay.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Ow...
What ? Are you my mother ?
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Checking........
I am thirty two.
Thank you, sir.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Better, sir.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
I don't know.....
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
<<belch>>
What happened ?
Thank you.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Yes.
Zach from work ?
Who was that guy anyway ?
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Oh, just put it over there.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
Don't mention it.
You're still asking me to break the law.
What do you remember about her.
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Her favorite poet.
Hi Dad.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
How about a nice glass of milk?
No.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Maybe he's hungry.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I've got something better.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
But I wanna write about her.
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
Then I have come to the right place.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
You're so clever.
MOM!
TAXI!!!
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
What difference does it make?
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Give it to me!
Just give it to me!!
DON'T, come on!!!
DON'T!!!
Owh...
What do you think?
But we wouldn't really be related right?
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Like what?
Some sacrifices are worth it.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
You want me to come with?
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
Phil for God sake.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
You know how I feel about you.
Bye Niece, Vada.
I was commenting on your hair.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
I'll be here.
Well maybe for you.
Sort of?
I bet your mom sang to you.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
What do you mean?
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Hey! Oh look.
You have no idea.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
All right, here.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
I'm impressed.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
What do you mean??
Oh that, she just likes to play.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
I'll second that.
Pointing upwards Look...
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Ahh, maybe next summer.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
Yes.
What??
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Thank you. Bye.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
We'd love to hear it.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
He likes her.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
No.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Come here, sit down.
Hi.
Uh huh, why?
Liverpool?
They're just fun to read.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Hey, where does it say that?
What?
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
I am not.
Duck!
What?
So?
I am running faster!!
But I have my clothes on!
But, I don't know how.
Okay, okay.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Would you think of me?
Something like that.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
You have a real philosophy of life.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
And you believe that.
Someday she'll thank you.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
What do you suggest?
Major.  Dish.
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
Oh, you're more than okay.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
He said that, too.
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
Ju...
Only.  If he wants to.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
I know Ben.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
Nobody has.  So far.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
What's next?
She finds him "personable."
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
You keep saying that.
It's more than that.
A bad combination.
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
She admits it's her fault.
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
DON'T SPEAK!
This is where I proposed.
To him.
Well, if that's the way you f...
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
I see.
You're so good.
Green.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Oh, sure.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
He knows better.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Whose?
President.
ABC.
Minimum.
D.C.
Where the hell have you been?
It's the den mother.
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
She's in Paris.
Harvard?
How in the world did he get shot?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
I'm not really a musician.
Suits me.
A little. What do you need?
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
No.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Do you carry door handles?
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
I've got a gig tonight.
I'm not sure.
Well...
What?
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
For him?
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
You're not.
How long have you been together?
Hello.
Why?
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Where are you from?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
You bet.
I see.
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
Yes, I would.
Yes, you are.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Don't stop!
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Thank you, sir.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
By all means.
I see.
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Not good.
Ready.
How 'bout Manson?
She sings? What does she sing?
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Says who?
When have they ever been right?
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Yeah, we have a van.
No.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
Got it.
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
We are.  Your camera.
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Survival of the fittest.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
That's my opinion.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Thanks.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Slate it.
They're mesmerising.
Why?
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
And me.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
No thanks.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
All right, you get out of here, man!
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
No. You got the wrong idea.
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
Where's he at?
Where was your father born?
Well, he worked around.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
Like hell they wouldn't.
Oh yeah?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
No. I'm new in town.
You work around town?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
You almost got into trouble back there.
Oh yeah, and then what?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Come here, baby.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
You didn't answer my question.
What about your boy?
Yeah.
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
What the hell could you do?
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
What d'you mean?
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
'Don't sound so sure.
Okay.
Okay.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
No, they won't.
Hell, I'm just like him.
Who is?!
Guess it's never been easy.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
Omar, listen to me--
I'm still on my honeymoon.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
What does this have to do with me?
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
I'd say you were full of shit.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
It hasn't yet.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
What about McCoy?
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
You're pleasant tonight.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
All things possible in Babylon.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Can you take me to it?
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
How's the ice break?
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
No!... No...
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Couple of months.
What's that supposed to mean?
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Case...
They'll cut you down.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
What went down between you and Riviera?
I know you have. C'mere.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
What?
Oh I know.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Nope.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
If you say so.
Yeah.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Oh. Right.
Have you been to any parties?
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
He's my teacher!
Hey. There.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
But I'm not a penguin.
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
I can't do this.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Yes, desperately.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
And a gymnast!
Sorry. Forgetful.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Don't look down!
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
Do you think you'll find her?
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
You were attracted to me?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
But now you don't have to--
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Nah uh.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Well, a ball player.
<i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
I know.
Just what?
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
No.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
It's getting there.
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
Yeah, why?
How come?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
Whoa!
I don't know - a sharp pain.
Oh, Jesse...
yeah, I had a bad night.
Why won't you talk to me?
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
'Morning, honey.
Huh?
Okay, I guess.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
Hi, Kerry.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Okay...thanks.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Don't hold your breath.
Watching TV.
No, she's right.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
I -- I think so!
He's real.
He's heavy in the halls...
Can't be good news coming from you.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
Everybody take five.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
What about Kristen?
And what are they?
What?
A sad choice.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
I'm not listening.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
Films mainly.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
I forgot my bag.
Thanks.  Well...
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
Okay.
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
She left me.
No, you were brilliant
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Well, get a message through to him too.
What do you think?
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Okay.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Hello.
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Nice surprise.
Is that right?
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Miracles do happen.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
The movie star?
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Di Caprio.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Can I help you?
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
And you get on very well.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
What?
What book?
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
Would you like to start?
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
Y-y-y-yes...
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
H-H-Hearts.
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
Thank you.
Are they all crazies?
What? Where?
Where ya goin', Mac?
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Huh?
What?
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
That's nice. Send me a post card.
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
No!
No!
Gary Blinker...
Hit me.
A nickel.
Yeah, Mac?
No.
He's not!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Oh, what was that?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Good. Good.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
How much ya wanna bet?
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Okay. Who else?
Yeah, what's up?
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Come an' see.
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
He's in charge.
Hi.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Big man!
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
Thank you, ma'am,
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Huh?
Yes, Miss Ratched!
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am...
You ol' fucker!
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
So.  How do we get to Rome?
What for?
No.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Except possibly that.
No.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
My name's 
Yes.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Who says I don't love him?...
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Mickey Spillane?
NO.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
What are you doing here?
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
You aren't?
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Just since yesterday.
Tonight?
Well, not exactly...
Oh, hello.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
Is he gay?
So?...
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
But it's July.
What about your job?
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Larry bought himself cologne?
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Oh my God.  Where?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
What?
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
What?
You sure you'll be okay?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
What if he doesn't like me?
My God... you're right.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
I'd love to.
Oh.
No, why?
No.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She didn't give me a chance.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Mania.
That's really romantic.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this— a deal I sweated and bled for— on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?—
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
I know. I know.
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
Which side are you with?
Man, you were a mess!
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
That was nice of you.
How do you like it?
Hit me again, Mac.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
What for?
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
You?
Edie— it's—
Are you sure they're your friends?
He's going to have to grow up too.
Let me by.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
I can? Okay.  Okay...
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Forty-five bills.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
By way of Chicago?
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
Go on, beat it!
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
Keep Charley out of this.
Okay.
Then..then what's that music?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
It would seem so, Master.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Ahh, there is yet time.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Well then let us proceed.
Then why do you shake so?
I'm so frightened.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
What?!
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Her phone's probably tapped.
Now you're talkin'.
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Whatta you wanna do?
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
Jack --
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
It was an unusual experience.
Is that what you would've done?
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
They're in 7D.
Why you think is today?
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
I don't smoke.
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
A little.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
In my bag, in the car.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Of course I am.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
You have to be kidding.
Really.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Who was it answered the phone?
Really.  He has a cop's face.
And your gun.
How do we do that?
You won't do that.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
I called your room from downstairs.
It would be worth the risk.
So do you.
He killed a police officer.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
I see better with them on.
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
How many?
Okay.  How many going out?
When?
Any time.
What's to think about?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I'm not leaving Midge.
Islamic.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
Meaning time came, I left.
Like what?
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
I remember you now.  Shit.
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Really?
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Can I do what?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
How you know that?
I <i>was</i>...
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
What did you call it?
It's a --
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
He's still married though, huh?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
I'd like that.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
Not at all.
So?
Like a fag.
Likewise.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
He was that good?
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Sir, I --
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
Where's that lizard?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
He did.
Good shooting, Rafe!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Yeah.
What facts are those?
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
Home of the Brave.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Hang on.
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Thank you, Sir.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Bombers.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
Brilliant, Admiral.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Learn English, then!
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Refresh my memory.
Why wait?
Great, isn't it?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Let's go down to the basement.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
It opens, too. Look inside.
I know.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Charlie? Was I dead?
Oh, God, Dion.
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
Okay.
I wish she hadn't.
It must run in the family.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Don't you get along with your parents?
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
I hate chickens.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
What?
That would be impossible.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Doing some shopping?
Open it.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
For what?
I don't feel very festive.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
I'm just happy to see you.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Why not? They're my favorite.
But accidents can happen.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
I don't know.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Am I dead or not?
Richard, take it easy.
Sixty—forty.
When do we start?
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
So are you. You've got a vision.
I... um...
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Zowie.
Right here, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
I am relaxed.
I promise!
Close the law book.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
Maybe you should think about it.
Ready for what, baby?
It's okay. Can I sit down?
One week old.
Little baby girl.
Continue.
Makeup.
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
What's her name?
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
You're ready, don't worry.
No. I didn't.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
Yes.
Sure thing.
You bet. We'll see you later.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Not unnecessary ones.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
Absolutely.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Yes.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Get real.
That's correct.
Give me the camera, Joe.
Probably since she was born.
That's perfectly clear.
Yeah... ?
Any women on board?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
You had one guy "like that?"
Helloooo...
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
Andy, you don't want this.
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Look deeper.
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Think about what?
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
One or two.
You sure you can keep --
Riddick? How close?
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
I can't....I can't....
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
Like the light is scalding it.
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Probably right.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
What?
Like what?
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
How many?
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
What, you're goin' off, too?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
You know who Muhammad was?
Riddick?
And what about the cells?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Oh, so I'm disposable?
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Said "looks clear."
Looks clear.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Just the same, I want one.
No.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
That way.
None at all.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Him.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Show this to the President.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Huh?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
We're here to stay.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Climb off me, will you!
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Don't bother
But I'm not prepared to die.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
My name is Taylor.
Mind your tongue, madame.
With one of them.
What about it?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
Maybe not.
Taylor, please --
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
This is his assertion.
He doesn't know.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
But there's the doll, sir.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
What?
Where's Elias come from?
Over here!
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
No... I move faster alone. 
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
Sounds like it.
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
Thank you.
Yes?

I'm sure you have.
Would you mind?
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
How do you do?
Why certainly, baby.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
How long would that take?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
I see.
What did you say his name was?
As I said before...
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
You didn't have to tell him that.
That's putting it mildly.
Is this the best you can do?
Absolutely sure.
You don't know who he is?
All right--following me.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
This must have cost a fortune.
Frozen.
Including Killaine.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Magruder does.
Do you think I was faking?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Ale. I don't mind.
What does he see?
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
Because you think your in love with me?
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
Sometimes.
Goodbye, Betty.
This way.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
Got the information on you?
What's a buzzer?
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
How's life treating you?
Hardly. Who's the girl?
I never notice the view after the first week.
Would that make me a heel?
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Go live in a tent.
Open it and count it.
So it seems Sergeant.
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
I think so.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
Warm water, no doubt.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
That leaves two strangers.
The card says so, doesn't it?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
What are my orders, sir?
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
Thanks.
I think you'll do very well.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Very good.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
I'm not sure I can face it.
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
Hello.
Freshman and sophomores...
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
How nice.
Both dead.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
I think she liked me.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
What did he want?
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
To the Fleet.
The Argies.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Fuck off.
Hello.
All right.
What about the Cromwells?
That's good.
No, thanks Dad.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
De nada.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Once.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
You gotta earn trust.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
SHIT!!
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
I'm not FBI anymore.
There's nobody else here...
Yes, sir.
Babes.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Caught my first tube this morning.
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
The shit they pull, huh?
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Did he rob it?
Nothing.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Sure.
What?
Warm them up.
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
Who cares!
Like the old days, Dillon.
This gets better by the minute.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Anytime.
What, Sergeant?
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
I'll take him.
The best friend I ever had.
It's been a long time, General.
What's that, General?
I think it's Hawkins.
There's no sign of it.
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
Twenty-five percent.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
What?
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
Yes.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Yes.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Sit... and spin.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
It pays.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
I sell them.
Of course.  How much?
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
You're forgiven.
I have work to do.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
He's good at what he does.
Ready to stomp sod?
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
Shush.  Of course you can.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
You just did.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Afternoon.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
I'm up.
Why?
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
He's not gonna want us.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
What if they serve soup?
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Excuse me?
Then I'm here till I die?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
Should I be?
I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
As you wish.
Of course you will.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
I thought I was going faster.
It's you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Over the Albino, I think.
Right, right, sorry.
I'll be right back.
What is it?
Yeah. It's really good.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
Do you want me to go on with this?
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
Okay.
As you wish...
Sire.
It won't be easy, Sire.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
No.  To the pain.
I swear it will be done.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
There we cannot help you.
-- power too -- promise me that --
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
Again. Thank you.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
Then why are you smiling?
Tell me.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Morons.
Good. Then pour the wine.
Hmm.
Australia.
I will. And I choose --
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
I'm not listening.
A good hour. Yeah.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Do the books!  Do the books!
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
You found a flop!
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
No way out.  No way out.
What???
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
Yes.
Really, I never dreamed ...
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
We swear it!
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
No.
I'm not the police.
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
No one met her?
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
How did she pay you?
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
How much?
Of course not. Please.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
With the forty thousand dollars?
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
She'll need both of us.
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
Without calling me?
Does that mean we can't...
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
You're not.
Neither will I.
This is the old highway.
I'm glad we didn't.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Bates never denied Mary was here.
I could stand something regular.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Sam!
Can you?
No.
Don't miss your plane.
Los Angeles.
Thank you. Again.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Crane.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Maybe you saw Mary!
Arbogast.
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
What--special autopsy?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Maybe you want my money, too.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
You would.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
So that's the way it is?
Thank you.
I'd love to, at any time.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Now don't that call for an extra!
I used to be married to one.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
Old Howard Winton's cub?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
Cry-baby?
Who'd steal her body?
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
You did miss --
Excuse me???
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
What is it, Rose?
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I said I wouldn't.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
How did the rabbits kill him?
Well, yeah.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Yeah.
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
No, son, she is dead.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
I think we both know her.
Oh. Did you say something?
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Is she all right?
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
I... I'll get the grits.
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Yes, sir.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
What?
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Oh, yeah?
She has other things to do, Dave.
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
Yeah, I remember it.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
Gonorrhea?
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
It'll get better now.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
... okay... you made your point.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
Now you know what to watch for...
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
I don't know.  Fuck off!
Again.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
That wasn't my fault.
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
I'm just saying...
Clench your teeth.
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
Entertainers don't count.
You don't smoke.
No, but it should.
Follow me.
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
We've got the tape to prove it.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
All for one...
Gimmie a minute.
Your wish is my command.
Who is that... ?
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
Know what I love about dynamite?
They're... around.
All right. Stand by.
Yoda will always be with you.
Luke!
Yeah, she's comin' up.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Ahhh...
Charges!  Come on, come on!
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Come on! Come on!
Red Leader standing by.
Oh, no.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
But, why must you confront him?
I will not fight you, father.
Oh. Well, yes.
Disintegrated?
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Rocky!
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
We must have a blow-out.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
You know this earth - this person.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
From Transexual Transylvania.
Goodbye
Now I
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Creature of the night.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...Goodnight, Rocky.
Absolutely.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
I don't think you're a bum.
...No thanks.
Do you have a phone?
Yes, I do.
I think he might be worried.
I don't think I belong here.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
I'll be waiting.
No... Sharp -- You look great.
Don't say that.
Paulie!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
You's the novelty, Champ!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
You're hurtin', man!
...Thanks.
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
...It's very American.
...Still don't feel no heat.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Of wa?
Does that bum have to say that?
Why?
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
What's happenin' here?
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
That's it, I'm broke.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
You think I don't hear things?
Yeah.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Black market?
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
Rocky.
No -- Just me.
Sparrin'?
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
I like yella teeth.
Why?
I said, how ya feelin'?
...Tomato?
Yeah, Kayo.
When was they here?
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
Yeah.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Great, kid, great.
It ain't your locker no more.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
I'm thirty myself.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Ice skate.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Whatta these guys want?
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
A tweeting bird?
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Ask her...
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
No...
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
He's right here in the...
What a gasser.
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Have you got the will?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No, I don't.
Divorce?  Never!
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
My brother.  Get inside.
Forget it.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
Uh? Uh?
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Am I like Such a fellow?
By my head here come the Capulets.
Of love?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
She'll not come down tonight.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Well, what was yours?
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
I'm up for that...
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
Which leads us to...
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
I thought I did.
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
You sure about this?
There's a problem...
Don't do it, Sam!
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
Enough!
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
You'll die if you leave here.
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
Now that is an interesting proposition.
I don't have it with me...
I sent it to myself in Paris.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
There is one other thing...
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
How did you know?
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
My way is better.
Did he bring that with him?
What a surprise...
I don't think so.
Coordinate what?
To see a man about a thing.
That's what I thought.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
I just wanted to see something.
Gregor's cell phone...
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
Not exactly.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
It's my job.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
You think?
Right now?
Business keeps you on the road?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
I think not.
Why not?
Closest and oldest.
What?
What of it?
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Seamus Reilly.
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You slept with the fucker!!
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
I can't get enough of it.
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
I hear you.
Cash and what?
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Maybe.  Who cares?
Torch it?!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
You killed him...
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
That's right.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
It's NOT too late!
Rock solid.
How much?
Just take it in stride.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Shut up, Jesse.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
You mean that guy was an agent?
What for?
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
Has he?
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Nothing.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
How the hell did he find it?
Great...
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
I don't believe it.
What?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
What are you getting at?
Maybe I should come along.
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Have you known this all along?
No, I can't say that I have.
No I don't.  You sure you haven’t seen her?
Sure.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
So be here at three.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Calm down --
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Yeah.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Give me the bad news.
Anything in it?
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
I'm not getting an answer.
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
No, sir.
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
So what's your story?
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
Those girls drove off because of you.
No.
No.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
I knew you were lying.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
I'm calling for back up!
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
What did you say?
Gimme the binoculars.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
What is it?
She's walking back towards the door.
It's a bomb.
She never even looked at you.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
No.
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
End of the line.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Dancing?
No.  I'm going to find out.
Yes.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
It's okay, I got lots more.
New York City?
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
Just trying to make it look real.
No.  But I'll help you.
Now you know.
The Secret Service?  Why?
Did you tell Sterling?
You must come with me for questioning.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
So was I.
We are both full of shit.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
It was not my intent --
I know a shortcut.
What plate?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Stool pigeon.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
I got to stop that dancing in the street Œtill all hours.
No, fish is a PM food.
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
Oh yes.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
The Feds?!
No...what?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Carter, shut up!
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Or somethin'.
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What are you talking about?
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
She's fine.
It's Griffin.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
I still have work to do here.
I was trying to find the right time.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
What?
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
I already made an appointment for later today.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Looking for Maggie.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
-- The luau for Maggie.
Yes.
Without oxygen...
A pre-wedding luau?
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
A little longer for me.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I love you, too.
So am I.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
Quick.  Very quick.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
No.
It sounds nice.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
They're going to love you.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Happy New Year.
Walter, I'd love to --
What is it?
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
And then I'll see you in New York --
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
What?
No.
You couldn't.
So what happened?
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
What?
Nothing's with me.
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
Actually, he sounded nice.
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
So I mailed your letter.
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
No, I'm not. 
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Yes.
What?
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Destiny takes a hand.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
What?
It's a sign.
Hello.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
I don't think I could really describe it.
It's not that late in Seattle.
It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
Right, right.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
What is it?
I don't get it.
I don't know.  Do I?
I don't think I have to now.
P.  Dad?
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
English muffin.  How do you do it?
Whose show was this on?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I don't know.
Good.
I was thirsty.
No.
Shut up.
What about it?
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
He's good at it.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
No thanks.
How's it going?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You want 'em all arrested?
I don't make policy.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Yes. We will light the candles.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
What has it got me, your union?
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
What makes you so sure?
Can be what?
Sure.
Yes.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
I thought maybe you forgot...
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
First rate, ain't it?
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Everything go?
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
And you admire that?
Nothing.
You really need to lighten up.
What is wrong with you?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
Therapy session is over.
You can still work.
I just can't. Okay?
I can't tell you.
I don't want to leave you.
It's Tom.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Guess it's our turn.
Twelve
Why's that?
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
Can you set that up?
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
You aren't coming with me.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
Hey, check it out...
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
Good for you Jimmy.
That was my idea.
What does that mean?
Secret recipe.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
Big Bill.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
Yeah, dickhead.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
Question is, what are you doing here?
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
This chink have a name?
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
What?!
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Again, I thank you.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
In West Fork?
No kidding.
The Army gave you that?
Shit, that was no big deal.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Cap'n...?
Of course, sir.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I guess.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Senator's son?
You know classical music?
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
Same place we are.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
How about you shut up and take your position?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Yeah.
And what about your own hand?
You're welcome, John.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
I coach the baseball team, too.
Here they come.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
What are we likely to run into?
Captain, he's fast!
We know.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Who knows?  It worked.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Understanding the following rights...
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
For going to school?
Excellent.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
That's just so embarrassing.
Hang in there, man.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
I dream about it.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
I can accept that.
Alright.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Oh yeah!
Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I love you dad.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Goodnight.
Dad.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
You're going.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
What am I supposed to think?
You're right.
Hi.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
Pardon me?
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Twisted?
Job?  Being a great date.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Today is tomorrow.
Come on.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.
This is so noble.
Then why are you shaking?
No, we don't have to say it.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
No I didn't.
Oh shit.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
No.
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
What?
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
I called her up.
You know Diane Court?
Yeah, alright.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
I don't know.  Soon.
Look -
Yeah, I can.
There's nothing in the stores.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Do what?
Thank you.
I think it's too late.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
You did so much.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
What is it?
That's smart.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
What?
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
She dumped me.
I'll get my jacket.
Let us decide that.
No, it's not.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
I find his work overwrought.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
I think you're all an act.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
What are we looking for?
Can we turn the light on?
..and as lonely as I am...
Over here.
That's not the way we play the game.
Stay away from the cop.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Oh my God.
Where is your attacker?
I have to watch rehearsal.
Don't do this.
Yeah, right.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
Gale?
Closer than you think.
Where you going?
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Hello.
Do I?
But your voice sounds so familiar.
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
More of a game really.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
There's more.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Catch him, or kill him.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
What Rielly?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Sid I can see you!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Someone stole Sid's file?
Fuck!
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
But you know who she was.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
Need to get in that building?
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
They're the ones who approved it.
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
What are you talking about?
Let's get out of here!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
What?  What movie?
Who is this?
How do I know their voices are --
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
No one's saying you did.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
You know it.
She looked dead. Still does.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
You sleep in THAT?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
I'm going... I'm going.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
You have to move on, Sid.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
What?
I called my dad.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Guess.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
Don't hang up on me.
Don't...
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
More of a game, really.
Or else what?
I'm getting scared.
NOOO!
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
No it's not. It was Jason.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
How is everything?
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
The phone's dead.
Yes, that's right.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Have you talked to Cotton?
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
I saw him leaving wearing it.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Ricki Lake.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
And why is that?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
So where are you?
That's the original part.
Uh-huh.
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Yeah, okay... whatever.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
He was there, Tatum.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
And you believe it?
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Give it to me.
I'm in.
So what?  This victim...
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
You'll see.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
Murderers?
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
It's close.
Shut up!
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
I realize that.
Is there any blood in it?
Guessing at this point is useless.
No.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
What?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
Hello.
I read.  Remember reading?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
No.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Oh, that's all.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
No.
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
You got to be kidding.
We're focusing.
It's not what you think it is.
No point in arguing anymore...
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
I will.
I can't let you do this...
I don't know why... why now?
I don't see anything.
Oh... um, William.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
I'm sorry, I only...
He mentioned it.
You should look into private schools.
I hate this city.
I want to have children.  It's just...
How should I know?
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
How far's the river from here, Mose?
How many, would you say?
Sir?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
You've done a lot of growin'...
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
Not likely.
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Not no more.
It's what I'm countin' on.
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
From the beginning...
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Well I ain't one of 'em!
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
It isn't fair...
Come on, say it.  You know...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Do you have a better idea?
You?
I just had a really strange experience.
And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Just call me Elisabeth.
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Right you are, governor!
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
On my mother's side the Ardens
Cut his nose off.
And his ears.
Partners!
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
it will be all right, madam.
Every word.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
What? Who?
What do we do now?
How goes it, Will?
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Do you think?
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Verona again.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
I have to get back.
The same, alas.
Oh, not for the world!
It is strange to me, too.
There is.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
Virginia?!
I am going to church.
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
You are on my ground.
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Can we talk about something?
Now.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
Your friends.
Where do you think you'll go?
This is just an informal discussion.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
What?
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Yes.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Yes.
Really?
Just serve.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
What I am.
You're right.
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
So what's wrong with that?
Open it.
Yes.
Don't look?
Is that all?
And now you tell me.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
For ever and ever.
Don't you?
Oh, good.
No.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
We were just sorting things out.
No.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
You mean I can have the room?
Burglary?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
Did you ever kill a man?
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
With a face like this?
It was on the television.
Sorry?
Exactly what I was --
I'm boring?
That one, last week.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
It's a breeze.
It's an improvement.
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Maybe... why do you ask?
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
Gee, that's very serious...
It turned out to be cancer.
I don't want to place you in any position --
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
You're looking great, baby.
Whatever you say.
Yes.
I don't know. Just a minute...
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
Hello, George.
Right now, I just don't care.
Uh-uh.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
Her?
I guess so.
No thanks.
Yeah.
... yeah.
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Right.
Great.
Right, that's right.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Probably the bathroom.
Whew.
It's hot in here.
Yeah... wow.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Did Lester know about him?
I know... you don't know, I know.
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Fuckin' A --
You were great.
-- oh I thought you were --
Look who's talking.
Not me, pal.
-- do you want ice?
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
What?
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- why did you come in today?
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Where?
What?
George, I don't --
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Fine. How are you?
I am?
-- Sure.
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Who?
I'm very tired, George.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Where did this come from?
I just want to know, that's all.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
Did you?
Did you?
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
No?
In a way. But...
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
Thank you.
You're right.
Sure.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah?
... this doing hair it's...
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
What, do you think I planned it?
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
What about her?
No --
Yeah.
What do you mean?
A soap?
Is that right?
Who do you think I was talking to?
Then you were talking to him.
Aren't you going to have one?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
Oh yeah?
I'll call you.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
I guess not.
-- No. No really.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
Honey?
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
I don't think so.
Of course not.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
That's fine --
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
No... how long did you say?
No, it's not that...
No.
Have they sat down?
Yes, Dad.
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Do you feel bad?
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Do you like this hotel?
I guess so.
Do they know he tell you things?
Is there something bad here?
What about Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Danny, come on over here.
Okay...oh!
I won't, Mom.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny!
Yes.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
A nigger.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
What line of work are you in now?
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
Your money's no good here.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Yes.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away from me.
Wendy...
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well...
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
Fine.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Let me help you up.
For getting a divorce?
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
What?
Yeah! What is it?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Oh?
Really?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
SING!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
Yes?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Joey -- do it.
Oh my! 
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
Why?
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Am I?
Because we're
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
That man -- who is he?
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
Wet behind the ears.
Again!
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
She won't?  Why not?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
Experience!  Right?
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Mary Clarence!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
Enough joking.
What?
You mean black people?
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Would you like that?
And whom would you call?
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
Out of the question.
The majority has spoken.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
I must go where I can be of use.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Get a stenographer.
Maybe Hawaii.
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Oh-huh.
They open a window.
Who are you guys?
Yeah...
It didn't work, Vince.
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
That should have tipped us.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
That was exciting!
It's better than ice cream.
But how do we get there?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
I shall, gladly.
The militia?
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Believe?
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I did not ask you to, did I?
Up.
Father said witches live there.
Listen.
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Small talk.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
There is no such thing as magic.
If you want.  But...
I insist that you have it.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
What did you say?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
I do not know.  Away.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
I can show exactly.
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
No.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Can I see him?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
What you got in there, warshing?
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
They was a boy. We made friends.
It's too big.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
What do you want, hun?
Would y'all like that?
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
Childers.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
What numbers do you punch?
Yeah.
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Why did he do that, reckon.
Yeah.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
All right then.
Naw.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Yeah.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
I've got a feelin' today.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Mama?
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I ain't got no boy.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Tolerable, I reckon.
I didn't aim to.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
All right then.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Not really to speak of.
How long have you been standing here?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Signs?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
American literature. What else?
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
What's that, Sol?
What's the difference?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
You're looking good, Auggie.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
It means "happiness."
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Yeah, like what?
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
What difference does it make?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
And these?
You mean Rashid?
And you told your nephew about it?
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Huh?
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
I owe you something.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
I mean breakfast.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Yeah, I can believe it.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
You don't really want to know.
Why don't you go to the police?
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
The end.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
You done your math right.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
You're implying th...
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
Oh, in a heartbeat.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Objection!
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
I have told the truth.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
He hit his head.  On the way in.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
I'll take two.  One for later.
I was checking the cables.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
I don't think so.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Not in those words.
That's all he said.
Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
It's entirely mutual.

Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
We're not too late, are we?
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
Knock it off, will you?
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
They got the bull-fiddle.
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
Watch it, Daphne!
Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
Polish?
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
Fight it.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
You think he's too old for me?
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like right after the ceremony.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Yeah - lets shove off.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Well, I'll come back later.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Oh - here and there - and around.
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Help yourself.
Me too.  Bye now.
You don't say.
I'm not surprised.
Wanna bet?
We won't breathe a word.
What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
Yes, Joe.
My car?  Why, you -
You got to be under twenty-five -
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Every time!
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
Glasses?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
Saxophone player?
Just my feminine intuition.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Why?
Well, I'm not.
- Inauguration balls -
Tonight?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
They just sort of leave me cold.
You mean you can't fall in love?
What happened?
Is it that hopeless?
Have you ever tried American girls?
From a rich millionaire.
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
You and who else?
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
What for?
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Bacardi 151.
Pub Golf?
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Hey.
Sure, disappear. We’ve been walking away our whole lives.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you’re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you’ve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn’t outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn’t feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don’t know, but your misery just isn’t working for me anymore.
What for?
I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
Um, just about everyone.
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Yeah, kind of.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
No.
Doesn’t look like nothing.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like we’re trying too hard to look like we fit.  It’s welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
You have feet?
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
Show me.
I’ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it’s the words: “morally repugnant.”
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
Yup. That’s why you get to keep your money.
You’ve always got that to hide behind, don’t you? It’s just business!
What?! No, no. You can’t--
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Hi, kiddo.
“...but it’s getting there. “
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation’s most precious resource: your daughter.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Is he here in Borderdale?
Yes, mam...
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
They gone to the field...
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
Thank you, Daddy...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
What's that, son?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Goodnight.
That's right!
Same as we -- they pray.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
No mam -- I looked all over.
Listen, Mama...
Come in, children.
I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Tired.
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Little chilly.
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Montana.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
You bet your fucking ass it was!
What Cartman?!
Whoops.
No way.
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Okay.    Not.
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
Help yourself prickfuck!
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
A hunger strike? For what?
I don't know.
Hey, Chef.
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Uhh...
Baba mama!
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
Aw, ma!!
Dude, what the hell is going on?
Yeah, I guess.
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
We can't leave without you!
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Yeah...
YOU BASTARD!!
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Totally!
Yeah, they suck.
Yeah, so what do we say?
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Yes?
Oh.
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
You bet, Terrance!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
You did? Just now?
I am.
I know.
Don't call me dumb!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
Anna...
Magnificent, magnificent.
Of course, of course...
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
That's clear.
Will you shut up already?
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Just considering our options... sir.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
Close every door behind you!
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Sure.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
You too.
Barnes?
Try not to think about it.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
That is one of my priorities.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
How am I supposed to know?
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
One moment please...  one moment please...
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
That's affirmative.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Are you guys bruddas?
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
La da da dalala...
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Grace Skinner.
Don't say that about my mom!
I'm getting to like it here.
I gotta survive.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I couldn't care less.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
See ya 'round Maynard.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
I found dad.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
They suspended me.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
The mental hospital.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
No, I'm fascinated.
Well, that was plan A.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I could let them go for ten.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
It's Junior, isn't it.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
At least I'll die smiling.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
I'm not here to bowl.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
I can't see...
I said back away.
Captain.
They didn't tell me anything.
A thousand feet.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
It doesn't make any sense.
Take a look.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
-- and then brought her down here --
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
They're coming.
Nothing, sir.
What the hell is going on here?
Well, where the fuck is he?
What's the message?
Radiation shield, you think?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
Sir, about leaving --
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
Too big?
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
That's quite a secret.
Underwater?
It never occurred to me.
The library.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
What?
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
What are they?
You went through Edmunds' things?
What?
I have to reset the sub.
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
He what?
We must've had it delivered then.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
How can the sphere do that?
It's a soporific.
Causes sleep.
I'm feeling better.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
C'mon -- what?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
Beth --
I never said that.
In time for what?
Another attack?
We can refuse to talk.
Wait a second, I --
Look, would you --
To what?
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Gimme another explanation.
Am I?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
Then what, Norman?
What noise?
Did I?
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
How do we decode it?
The three of us.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
Help me lift her.
Shut up and catch.
No idea.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
You mean forget?
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
But it's impossible.
Meaning?
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
The ships?
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
Really?
Told me what?
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
You mean a picture?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Don't be so supportive, honey.
I don't know.
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
This isn't a game, you know.
Not bad.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
I know that.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
You mean we should go after her!...
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
What's that?
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Was this trip really necessary?
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
What are you saying?
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
Move out of the way!
Who is this?  What's your operating...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
Hey, check it.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
Funny...
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
You're upset, that's alright.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
How do I know if this is love ?
Good luck at the academy.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
I can't help it.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
What happened to your eye ?
See you on the bounce !
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Hut... hut !
You got it.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Looks like rain.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Oh, is that how it is ?
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Uh, no.
Hi, mom.
You can never be sure.
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
Good for you. Go find out.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Yes, sir...
You may proceede.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
You are what...?
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Our Exec and Science Officer...
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Hold relative position here...
I want him here.  Sit down!
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Any reply from them?
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
The point... 
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
We're ready, sir.
Helm ready, sir.
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Tractor beam remains constant...
Annie...got an umbrella...?
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
It was either that, or a sardine.
As the Old Mill goes around...
Goodbye.
Yes...
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
<u>Yes</u>...
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
Paperclip?
Better idea...
"Room Service!"
The other side.
You believe that?
Sure did.
I hurt you?

What?
You know what else a man can do?
Not without a rolltop desk.
Carla was in the car, right?
...I'm sure that people are upset...
After Drama Group.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
What are they offering?
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Well, then, what's he doing here?

You can go...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
Everybody needs a hob...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
Who is it raped you?
I wasn't in the car.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...

Yeah.
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
I can't do it, Walt.

He should be put in jail.

Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
I can only write on a manual.
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
I know you do.
Where have you been...?
I hurt my finger.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
I'm gonna nail it.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
You want me to lie.

That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Sherry, this...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
George, that is so kind of you.
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
Excellent point.
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Like how?
Well.  It's for you.
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Maybe twenty.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I'm not.
Until he's old enough to read.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
And this is my room so get out!
Why don't you say hello?
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
Annabelle put down that camera.
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Mom...?
You have the WORST flu since...
No!  I have to get there.
You dying.
But you can still see him.
So where are you?
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Have you still never told him?
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
You think I didn't get that?
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
WE are over.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
Look, I...
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
...it's my problem, too.
You're not dying.
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
Thanks, but it's under control.
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
You mean, after I'm dead?
Worked.  Like a charm.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
Yeh, it's cheaper.
Jesus.
For what?
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Oh, yeah?
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
He was in a concentration camp?
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Great to be here.
Four brothers and five sisters.
I'm still poor.
My baby.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Yes, I do. I love them!
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Is everything OK?
Fine.
You mean, again?
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
What are you doing here?
Uh huh.
Thanks.
...gger.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Three.
Thanks.
No, I don't think so...
Yeah. I know.
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
He did?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Well get someone down there!
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
What happened!
Even better.
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
You're going to pay for this...
Shut up!
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
Richter-we got a problem!
Excellent...excellent!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
What does that mean?
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
Yes, of course.
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
I know nothing of the sort!
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
What?
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Do you recognize my voice?
No, sir.
Condition Red!
A shooting war!
Yes, sir.
You're right, sir.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
Admiral Buldike?
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
Lothar, take your checks now.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Maybe it's an exercise.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Maximum ECM!
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
They're moving apart.
Yeah?
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Primary trigger switch.
First safety.
Master Kong.
Everything still checks out okay.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Listen, give me a shot quick!
What do you mean?
I don't get you, King.
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
But who would be chosen?
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Yeah.
Was it okay?
What did you guys think?
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Oh.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Ah!
No, no, I wasn't trying.
What, they're looking for her?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Erica is in the van back there.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
No, no, no.
Guess not.
Jeff! Let's go!
Come on.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
I will.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Are you talking to me?
Oh, you were there?
Hey, thanks, man.
I could.
I'll be in the car, okay?
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
It's nice here. It's different.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
He is.
What about me? I don't have a car.
Really?
Let's see.
What was your name again?
Taking care of business.
We were?
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Because I'm alienated.
Sooze wants to see him.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
What?
Oh, shit.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
That, that's Indian?
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Is that Bee-Bee?
That's right.
I hate that.
No.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
About what?
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
I don't know.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No. No, no, no.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
For a ride.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
So how's college?
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
What?
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
What do you mean?
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
I'm always serious.
That was so great!
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
Yep.
That's because I am.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Whatever.
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Yeah.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
I'm here.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Wayne Gretzky.
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
No...I've been pregnant.
You sure?
And they get caught!
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Spit from your dad?
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Well, I want to know what happened --
He is the Great One...
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
We were told you could "fix us up."
He Ikea'd us.
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
Hold on...
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Let it ride for a while.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
What's wrong with it?
Why, you sweet kid.
Phillip, you're mad!
What teacher?
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
I just don't.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
No.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Get out.
Get out!
Yeah?
And you'll play Salome?
Fair enough.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Just follow me.
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
"Mad about the boy."
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Good.
I think I'll read a little.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Go on in.
Wipe your feet!
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
No?
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
No, a super girl.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
What do you want?
Later.
Why not ?
You don't like me? You hate me?
Well...I guess one is all right.
Just like that?
But why?
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
What?
How do I fight it?
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Theories?
How do you know?
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
She's a beast.
You sure?
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
What? Me?
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
Throw him out.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Then come with me.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Better than when I was a child.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Zaltar!
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
You thought that?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
There's a lot of choices here.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Uh-huh.
At one o'clock in the morning?
Nope, but --
Say what?
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
But the bridge...
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
But the other night...
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Diet soda?
Where do you usually find a light switch?
In other words, push this red button.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
Today coffee----
Where did it come from?
Yeah. I'll check.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
In July???
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
What??
We'd better talk.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Uh...home...
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
What else is ballast for?
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
What's a curl?
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
No possibility for parole?
I asked the right question.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
It will. Starting with your own.
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
What about here?
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
I'm not so sure you do.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
. . . And  very naïve!
Who?
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
You're just an experiment, freako!
What do you fear?
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
Bunkers!
I know son, I know...
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Not really, no.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Jealous? Of what?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
You think he's for real?
Tough guy, huh?
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
I know...
A night on the town instead of under it?
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
All of us.
Folks'll ask question.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
How good it felt!
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
I came to talk to you.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
I guess they are a little odd.
195 pounds.
What about it?
Uh-huh.
Pink.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I...uh...check.
It is for me.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Maybe I should get help.
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
Alison Jones.
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
Are you still in touch?
Which one?
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
That's okay.
Alison.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Okay.
Why?
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
Billy, that's too early.
No.  It should be dry by now.
I better get back.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
From what?
Yes.  He does.
I didn't say that.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
Well, winter's far behind us now.
It's the truth.
Okay.
What, Mason?
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I won't lie.
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
Thank you, Nicole.
She...she was a friend of mine.
No.
Almost three.
Perfect.
Thanks.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
Yes.
Yes.
I need money.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
You've been retained?
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
Do you have this agreement with you?
No.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Yes, I understand.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
The ramp?
Very slick.
It's okay.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
How will he do that?
I don't know.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
You don't know that.
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Alone or surrounded?
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
We're on our way there now...
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
I doubt that it matters any more.
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
See my mother?
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
I'm late for a date with a dame.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Hurry back.
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Susan!...
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Not just this minute, J.J....
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
I don't?
I'll listen one more minute.
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
I read your column every day...
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
Yes, but why?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
What ship?
Like you?
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
My mission is to protect you.
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
I would.
Max.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
I'm sorry, John.
I order you not to!
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Alright, it!  We need it!
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
Unknown.
So do you.
Correct.
Then what?
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
No.  There is another chip.
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Eating is eating... and...
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Five minutes.
Yeah.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
Colonel. Pleasure.
Three months.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
I wish to say something.
And what was that?
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
Yes, von der Null.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
Of course I know what that is.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Me? Never.  Never.
Do you know what's in this archive?
How could I forget?
Show you?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Yes.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
You're late.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Alright!
I won't let the fat kid down.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
All.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
About where you're from.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
That's the way it was told to me.
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
I want it to be over for you.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Kyle...
Ticklish?
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
Yes.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Okay.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
The stock will turn.
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Then, you kiss his ass.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't know... he fell.
Don't just stand there, get help!
What... is... happening... ?
A game?
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
My hero.  Let's go.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
What's C.R.S.?
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
God, wake up, it's a con!
Get out.
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
I didn't say anything.
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
Stop talking...
Shut up!
Claire.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Yeah.
Why?
I'll call them, okay?
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
You dodged a bullet.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Really?
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
Stop it!
What is?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
Is there a room key?
No, you didn't...
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Goodnight.  Where was she?
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
I know who she is.  Take a message.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Follow me.
I did okay.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Just stay there, Nell!
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
No.
And that will be a good place to end this study.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
Why?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
That?  That's Hill House.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
Why'd she kill herself?
Why would we --
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
It's all I could afford.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
I have a loft.
I don't know, you know...
-- What do you think?
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
I don't think I want any.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
Then what good is he?
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Where do we go?
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
Lookin' good.
Eduardo.  Rama.
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
Y'what?
I only asked.
Did Jenny know?
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Again?
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
You look alike.
It's been a while.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
How'd you manage that, then.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Why not.
Have you ever known me not to be.
I'll bloody well ask him.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
How do you know?
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
All of what?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Yeah.
The forever kind.
Good luck.
Something's on.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
What do you think?
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
I don't want you here, Terry.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Be seein' you.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Who?
Hello, Birdy.
Geez, Mr Crane.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
...Uh-huh.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
That right.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
I'll have it in a week.
Sure.
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
Mm.
All right, I guess.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Big Dave--
Just coffee.
Told what?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
What happened to you?
You don't have to tell me anything.
It was Big Dave's.
*I* was with her.
He and Doris... were having an affair.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
OK. Boy. Jesus!
I'm fine. Thanks.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
What the--
...Nah.
Crane. Ed Crane.
Yeah--
Hello.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
Let's go!
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
Apparently it's huge.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
What are they?
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Big as a house.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
He's right.  Follow me.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
It's reptilian.
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
Eats them?
How about lunch?
Okay.
And John?
I don't understand.
A monster?
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
You were behind me?  Running after me?
All right.  If you're positive.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
--a dead one at that.
That and a fat, new contract.
It has to be the reality.
Certainly a nomination.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
That's right.  Lauren.
Now.
I...I can't.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Your Dad?!
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
Yeah...
What's that?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
How do you know?
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
So why do you want to go?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
I bet you did.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Do something...
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
--How do you know about that?
We don't even know you.
Sorry. Don't have one.
When was that?
Yes.
Yes. I know.
Nothing completely conclusive --
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Yes.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
Kurtzweil, we think.
You got some kind of business with him?
No. Don't bother.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
I know the name. Why?
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Before the bomb went off?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
How's that?
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
No.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
Evidence of a massive infection.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
I don't know why I think they went right.
-- of what exactly?!
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
For the purpose of what?
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
Thank you.
And they want to blame us?
Where's Scully?!
I'm not taking any chances.
I want to know where Scully is.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
Driver.
What about you?
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
Peter, okay?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
Okay, okay...
Little boy?!  That's him!
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Yep.  Eloped.
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
It doesn't matter...
I got it.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
I think that's the whole point.
Dr. Kent.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
It's his dog.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Ja, ja, ja.
Do you understand German?
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
In German?
Tell you what?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Anna.
We're both in it, Harry.
Yes.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
I don't know.
I shall be all right.
I saw him today.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
No.
No.
Two weeks ago.
I don't know.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Martins.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
What?
Best thing that ever happened...
You're not locking her up?
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
I'm not asking you to.
Well?...
No.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Which side of the road?
Of course.
I said you win.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
This way, miss.
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
What about?
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
What is it, Sergeant?
Who?
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
You wouldn't do anything.
You've got plenty of contacts.
What did he say?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
The Roumanian?
How do you do.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
Nice work.
That's the wrong one.
So how many miles do you think it is?
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Yes.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
I'm sorry.
It's on an island that no one get to.
Two.
Not too bad.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Richard, you know something -
So?
Uh-huh.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
That's stupid. Why would they?
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Oh, really?
What's it mean?
No difference.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
They're liars and cowards.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
I agree.
What??!?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
What were you, following me?
The arguments, anyway.
You're lying.
I can't say that.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Daniel Balint.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
I've got to get back to the --
Number ten.
The mother.
What...?
Here...
Who even knew?
Where?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Why me?
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
He was funny.
Valentine...
They're not that Jewish.
I was just trying to make a point. If --
Yes.
But your man isn't quite a God!
The documents are forged.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Italian is practically the same thing.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
What was he like, when he was little?
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
I didn't say...  Brussels!
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
... And his friend, Johana...
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
I don't want to erase anything.
... Yes.
Thank you, thank you very much!
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
It's too loud for me.
Thank you...
... The way she moves.
It's me... Johana.
Absolutely positive.
You go back, I'll walk.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
I saw how it has to be.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
No.
Again?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Let him sleep.
What's your first move?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
What's up?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
Mordechai!
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Worse.
Resting?
That depends. How much money has he?
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
I don't know —-
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
What arroyo -— how did you get to it ——
That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
No. I'm quite sure.
About Charlie's leopard?
Charlie likes his leopard.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ——  Don't you?
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
I thought -— is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
Must it?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
Disney! How inter...
You... You found that at Leon’s?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Excuse me?
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I’m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
Paul Lamont...?
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
You’re mad...
I guess the news you’d sent me after Friedman didn’t go down too well, eh?
Leon hung himself.
Leon hung himself...
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
You don’t say.
Simplify and damn.
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
Get to the point, will you...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
Can you tell me how you spell...
Croissants. Like that...
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I know where to look.
I wouldn’t mind. Thank you.
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
Yeah.
I don’t know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don’t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that’s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
B-Black...
I’ll call again.
Got it. Puppies.
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. Thanks for the lift!
It’s not.
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It’s important.
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Is my money in there?
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Shut up and drive!
Three o’clock.
Have you?
How are you, Rhian?
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
Yes...You-you’re not going to take Shiva away?
Oh, I... She just moved. I’ve got her new... It’s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Los Angeles?
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Eh bien... T’es sûr que t’as besoin de moi?  La petite m’a l’air assez bien foutue, non?
Alors quoi?
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
Then why don’t you reach him?
Gluck’s dead, you sonofabitch!
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
Shut up and walk...
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
I promise...
Yes...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
What... what do you mean?
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
Tell me...
But it is what I want.
Not yet!
I'm staying, Jean.
Good.
I don't know...
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Quite a few.
Yes...
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Last night.
Yes.
And may I go to Mass?
Silence her!  Take her away...!
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
But... her army's so small now...
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
That's not a lot.
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
The wind will be against us...
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
Damn right!
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
The clothes are not important...
Yes, but...
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
I'd sooner die than use magic!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
I said, kneel!
My king.
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
Playing...
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
So your memory's coming back?
Really?
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
Do you think you are ready?
Yes, my lord.
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Yes, it is.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Jeanne, be patient.
Who wants me to stop?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Yes.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Dorota.
What are you doing?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
I'll be fine.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
What's happened?
What, I'm working, what?
Who told you?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Yes, please.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
That makes a change.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
Hungry.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
You're amazing, Jehuda.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
I was listening, Kitten.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
God forbid!
No, I don't think so?
Sorry, I don't remember.
Watch his hand
It will be very dramatic.
Like it were a piano?
No sound at all?
That is good, yes.
Ohh the tag is broken.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
On your property?
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
You mean in signs?
No, not words.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
Do I know any gigs?
What's the line on Visitation?
He'll probably fall down.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
What do we do?
Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
I had some appointments.
All of it.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
I'm busy, Floyd.
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
Hackers.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
We'll get by without 'em.
Let him wait.
No, not a thing.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
The name is Lonnegan.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Where's June today?
Sixty-five.
I am after this race.
You're a lucky man, all right.
I'm in.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Let me talk to him.
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
Don't think I know him.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
He's just around the corner.
Another young man.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
What are you talking about?
Oh, Andy, Andy!
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
He's waiting for you.
Yes.
I've got to see you alone!
Where did you hit her?
Which way did she fall?
That's the truth.
Yes, she would.
And he still wants to marry me!
Better get home before it is.
What'd he think it was to you?
No.
I'll have to try to remember.
You mean about that gun?
What do you mean?
No.
--was Wynant's.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
No.
Goodbye.
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Never mind.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
Is Julia going with you?
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Yes...
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
This is your party.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Much better, thanks.
Six Martinis.
Someone get a doctor.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Who's that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Goodbye, darling.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
That's a fact.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Smart gal.
No.  Nobody but you.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Mimi...
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Home!
No, please, not again.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
What do you figure it to be?
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
I told you; don't push me around.
No.
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Knock it off!
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
Mine.
I heard it click.
Just relax.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
Shut up and listen!
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
It's giving.
Jesus, Jaeger.
We'll find our way!  We'll...
Wes is dead!
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Probably.
I don't have a weapon.
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
With what?  Against how many?
Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Thanks.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
He's going to slow down.
It doesn't mean anything.
How the hell should I know how much?
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
We have to do something.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Yeah, we're down.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Violation?
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
What happened?
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
Vocasity
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
Now.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
I don't know.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
AH UGH.
THX and me.
Impossible!
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
I want you for my roommate.
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
But you can't...you.
Look!
I was lost.
No, I...
Look more closely.
Too late....stay close.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
No!....
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Where you guys at?
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Would you?
Don't touch that.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
"Punks", huh?
We work fast enough for you?
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
A bowling alley.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Reilly! He's loaded!
Alex-
Nothing... just tired.
Take him!
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Nothing so far.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Look, it's important.
What kind of bomb was it?
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
Quiet!
I know.
Diamonds all over.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Umm.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
I hope so, too.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Otherwise I'll call the police
What do you mean?
I know it!
M'sieu Monescu!
Now just a minute, Major--
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
No--no.
I would like to.
No, thank you.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Last year? It can't be that long.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Darling!
What?
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Yes!  Now don't worry!
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Lily-- 
Yes.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
M'sieu Laval!
Too much blue in crimson.
Yes!
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
Good night.
Talk? About me--about us?
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
I know it.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
Please! 
No--thirty-five! 
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Jacques!
Well--uh--yes and no.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
I don't want your money!
That's true.
The pumps --
An hour, two at most.
Thank you, Rose.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
A hundred and one next month.
Don't you mean work me?
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
No, but we're making excellent time.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Well, here you are.
You're welcome. Rose.
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Yes, exactly!
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Just move with me. Don't think.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
I know, I know.
We'll find out.
Get in the boat, Rose.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
You had it the entire time?!
Excuse me.
Charmed, I'm sure.
It's so unfair.
Goodbye, mother.
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
How'd you ever get away with it?
Sure!
Baloney!
Glad to see you again.
Montana?
<U>Gladly</U>.
Where's Lother?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Guess again, copper.
Yes--
Very much--
Good-by.
Never eat before the show.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Well, I can't.
Sorry.
But--
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
I'll be waiting on deck.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
How're the tips?
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Are you screwy?
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
I'll take one. 
What is it?
It's a pleasure.
Much better--thank you--
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
I'll go with you--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Why?
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
How?
Send that.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
So what?
I thought I put you to bed.
Well, did you find me?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Yeah--
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Everything O.K.?
Like it?
No--not much--excepting-- 
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
What do you mean?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Meaning what?
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
I'm getting seasick--
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
Eh?... Oh.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
The country boy's about due.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Why?
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
"Smooth's" the word.
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Nice voice.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
This brand.
Well... 'bye.
Yeah, you look it.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Enough?  Never.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
In vino veritas.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
No...
I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
I don't.
What?  But I saw 'em-
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Awful lot of money.
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Wyatt...
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Wait!
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
Drop his horse.
But this time they'll be ready.
Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
What're you talkin' about?
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Morg, use your head.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
Yeah, and dangerous.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
Sightseeing.
And still not a thing to watch.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
I'm sorry.
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Political considerations?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
He tied one on.
Who knows? Fog, night...
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Happily.
Thanks.  Take care -
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
- You're not.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
...I see.
Fueled and waiting.
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
Maybe. Maybe not.
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
They're too big.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You always got something to say.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
Do you think you won?
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Go back to sleep.
It would be nice.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
Just stay in bed and rest.
It's healing now.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
Tolerable well.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
Let me get you a cup?
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Don't shout!
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
I was just trying to make conversation.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Bye, house.
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Excuse me.
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
You mean that happy child?
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Yeah, right.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Murderer!
Did I get my package in the mail?
She's sick!
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Have you been replaced?
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Will you quit moving around?!
A lunchbox...?!
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
Sir!  No Sir!
Last present!
Uh-oh.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
But you're Irish!
You're not so old yourself!
I finished it off.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
All the time.
Nine thousand dollars.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
I was just waiting for the right time.
Carl, that's insane.
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
Honey, your father knows the President.
Hi.
Just watching you.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Will we get invited to the White House?
You can't make me.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Have you done your homework, honey?
I don't know.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
So you pay off our customs officials?
So go shower already.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Not this time.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
No.
An informant.
I'm aware of that.
It could mean that, yes.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Any idea how much?
Any way we can do it better?
Just tell me where she is.
You won't say anything to my parents?
Yes, I hope so as well.
Like you protected Landry?
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
What do you mean?
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
I'd fucking kill you.
What?
Out.
Are you clean?
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
It's Iggy Pop.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
It's no problem.
Aye.
No, I'm clean.
Cheers.
Nightmare.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
He made me lick it.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
You're all hear.
Fuck you.
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
you'll need one more hit.
Your usual table, sir?
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
Raise shields.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
A Federation starship.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Oh, please.
What do you know of my pain?
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
If we could send a distress signal...
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
What do you mean?
Damn.  Let's go.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
That's a little vague, Spock -
A "t."
The emergency channel, open.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Not possible. You were never alone.
I'm afraid of nothing.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
The ship needs its Captain.

Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
No. I will not.
I cannot go with you.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Senior exec.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Hi, Flynn.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Okay, okay...
For being on to Dillinger.
I'm certainly not.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
Right on the money!
Not a chance.
Let's get outta here.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
If you think -
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
It can be arranged...
Hah.
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
How about you?
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
It's too far!
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Probably.
Recognizers!
Come here.
Little more juice's all it needs...
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Strategic Air Command.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
End of line.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
We have to.
That's all going to change, Yori...
I'm shocked.
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Where are you going?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
What?
Here, check these out.
No way.  Not Dana.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Stay on him.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
The purse is still at the house.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Oral hygiene?
You're damaged goods, lady.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
You wouldn't believe me.
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
What about the husbands?
Those idiots.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Fuck you.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
I understand.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
Hello, Alabama.
Wait a minute -
Knock wood.
This is great, we got cable.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Don't eat anything.
The letter he sent.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Sure. Why not?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
How 'bout me what?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
Uh-huh.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
Really?
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
I heard that.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Can you live with it?
She's with me.
I'm her husband.
You got it.
Tomorrow.
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Now tell him goodbye.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
I know.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Elliot.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
No problems on both counts.
They'll be along.
Yeah?
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
I bullshitted him.
That's about all I ever eat.
She seems very nice.
What?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
No shit?
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
Sure was.
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
I didn't mean -
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
What are you going to do with us?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
And your only goal is...???
So that...???
I need to go.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
You wouldn't understand.
July?!
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
What's the matter with your leg?
Shot!  Who shot you?
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
It was?  I didn't...know.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
You... you left them a message?
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
What's that mean?
You know -- your plan.
It's private.
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
I'm here about some monkeys.
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
Yes, sir.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
That's 'cause he's dead.
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
Think you'll live that long?
More or less.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
Hundred and eight already.
It is not.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Out of here.
One way.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
So?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Time.
Twenty-after-ten.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
Open up!
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Let me have a Beck's.
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
I think I burned my gun hand!
Yes.  Yes it is.
John . . .
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
John--
They look nice.
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
I don't know your real name.
You sure you can manage?
You're welcome, Grace.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I guess it must.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
I have ideas.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
You just walk away.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
What about him?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
Give him the money.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I'm here.
What for?
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
Accident.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
I was hoping we could talk.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
Make it twenty.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
You didn't kill her?
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
All I have in the world.
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
You came to take my wife from me?
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
What?
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Will you shut up!
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Thirty-thousand dollars.
Eh?
No!
You want something?
That's 'cause he's dead.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
You afraid of the dark?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Who the hell are you?
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Would I what?
About things.  About your wife.
About what you said this morning.
I did?
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
It's the truth, Jake.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
What?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Open up!
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
Those are white words, not ours.
Like you.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
You know what I want.
How do you know he's still not here?
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Try me.
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
I'm sorry...
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
Stop it.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Where to?
But, in particular?
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Oh?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
No! No! Please!
There's someone in the house.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Four.
I'll keep it in my office room.
I have a lock on the door.
What does that mean?
Yes.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
Yes.
Jesus.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
What was that?
I don't know Megan.
Seventy-five percent.
You've misunderstood.
I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
Yes he is.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
I won't make any noise.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
What things?
You're lying.
How did you get together?
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
'Course he's coming.
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
You ain't dead.
You want... a free one.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
What's your name?
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
But he was called...
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
Yeah.
Shut up, Kid.
Tell me right off if you see him.
Yup.
Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
You ain't shot.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Well, she...
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Beats the hell out of me.
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
Yeah... you said that last night.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Best we move that pig.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Nothin's bent.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
Plenty of times.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
There's more.
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
You are a criminal.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
County. I was in for fraud.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
Mr. Soze will be most -
You're lying.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Waste of time.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
Keaton was a piece of shit.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
He loved her.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
Then why didn't you help him?
Because he was my friend.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
You think he's..?
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
It looks that way.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
Yes.
Yes.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
I am seventy-four years old.
I'm on the staff of...
Nothing further, your Honor.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Yes.
I . . ..
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
There's nothing they can do to me.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
Yes.
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I've got nothing to say to you.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
I'm sure you would.
That happens.
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes.  Price...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
I think I will.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
You're going to stay here...?
I...
No...no...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
I'm going to help her.
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Right.
The Doctors.
...one of the other nurses?
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I don't know.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
She did?
You live in the neighborhood?
Mrs...
I did.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
I married into it.
Then?
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
But you knew about this.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
What for? Who are you?
Do you live here in the hotel?
But before! Where did you live before!?!
No, you don't owe me anything.
Can I see you tomorrow?
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
We'll take it! Will it fit?
You can.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Ah, no!
Wherever you'd like...
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Too late. I've got my face on.
Madeleine died here.
I need you.
Scottie --
Your accident...
Where had you been before?
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
We have.
No birds live here.
No, thank you.
Yes...
What?!
Yesterday.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
No.
Only this far.
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
You can't.
Let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
Please let me go.
I won't lose you.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Please answer my question.
Carlotta Valdes?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
It's where you belong.
Ah, Johnny-O...
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
I'm having one now.
That's following a train of thought.
Normal.
Okay.
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Oh... this and that.
How soon can it be altered?
Can we have it by tonight?
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
I don't have to...
Playing?
It's sacrilegious.
You're pathetic.
The hell you do.
You don't know what you're doing.
I'm calling the ambulance.
Why?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Sure, why not.
What about the blood?
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
I can't do this.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
They're driving me nuts!
What?
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
Don't ever stare him down.
I know...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
So who's the lucky guy?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
Sweet deal.
Fish?
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Not tonight.
Here's his head.
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
What is her disposition?
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Shut up.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
Shut up Boyd.
He's having a problem here.
What you just said. Say it again.
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
What are you going to do?
What does that mean?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
The hell you didn't!
You have a King fantasy.
And what happens when you can't?
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
What's your point?
What? What's your point?
What?
You said nobody would miss her.
Goosed!
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
I do.
We missed the deadline.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
How could I know what else I forgot?
Well it's bad timing.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
It's vile!
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
With all my heart.
Okay.
Go down where?
We're leaving in three hours.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Not yet.
Well I do.
No. Just like an hour or so.
Okay.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
I'm working on it.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Can we just talk this out?
The prostitute.
It's too late.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
But...
What money?
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
He's your brother.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Have another drink.
Yup.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Greenpeace?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
What song?
I do.
...embarrassing, shameful...
A mutant species.
So where to on the honeymoon?
That's our plan.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
You'd like me to kill them?
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
Who is she?
Come down.
Evil.
And this innocent child.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Yes.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
And in the vegetable plot?
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
What are you going to do?
Where's the dough?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Stop this!
This louse is looking for trouble.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
But only you will know he's not human.
He was a computer program for crissake.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Then I guess we're even.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
I'M WHAT?!
It feels so.. .real.
This is supposed to be years away.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
All my work is my finest.
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
It wasn't a lie.
I know who would know.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
This is my area of expertise.
Nothing.
Start of what?
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Because this pain—in—the—ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
...I think so...You?
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
Why's that?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
For Schumann.
It's <u>producing</u>.
...can we have a white one...?
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
What rig?
All I need is the one day.
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
Who's gonna tell'em.
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
...take a long view.
Eight Days To Go 
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
Get on this, right now...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
...fourteen years...
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
...we own it?
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
I'll play your silly game.
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
When's he coming back...?
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
Why Albania?
The... 
...that's what it is.
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Might, if I was asked... 
Of what?
...givem what they want...But...
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
Is he dead?
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...
<u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
It's a <u>beret</u>...
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
I believe in you....
I'm just talking about the Hats.
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
Yes. 
...for the beans, yes...
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
Please, no thanks... 
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Coulda been a contender.
How's Mom?
About what?
Alright. Why so pissed?
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
He never told me...
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
No sir, that would've been illegal...
I remember that deal. You were involved?
...Gordon.
Upper West Side.
Yeah, almost...
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Why?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
It's over you, Gordon.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
You got it, G.G.
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Businessman!
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
Thank you
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
Vell.  Goodnight.
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
A little?
Hi there Sarah
Mom.
You guys are being real assholes
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
That's not true.
What do you mean?
Mm-hmm.
What does she look like?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Yes, but...
At the party.
I'm not...
Who?  Your husband?
I can't, no, no, I can't...
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
I've never even met you.
And then you weren't there.
Um...sure.
It's fine.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
I should be going anyway.
Do we have to?
Good.  I'm good.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
Yep.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Jody, no...
...no...no...no...
What?
The planchette?
Shhh.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Please.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
No.
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
Yep.
Three o'clock.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Fine.
You are...
Shhh.
That's not what I'm sug--
But what if something happens?
Mmnph.
Unless you need me to come home...
You are so brilliant.
You're kidding.
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
You told me that I was...
STOP IT!
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Huh.
Nothing.
Shhhh.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
But you've not told Michael.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
Michael, Rowan should -
Every day  twice.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Nothing worse than a common tool.
Then you wear it.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
When did she die...?
I had you sent away.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
Better than most, I suppose.
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
It wes a dream...!
FAST.
Lie...?
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
Go away!  I don't want you here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
I love Michael...
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
Rowan...
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
You still feel that crazy...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
Their what...?
A little wine...?
Dropped it.
Did you see the old man on the ---
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
You bastard!
If you like that type.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
You really love this guy...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
The one on the left - definitely...
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
I don't know...
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
No - I'll have you after
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
Yes - of course.
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Maybe he got promoted.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
Dead?
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
I love those springy head puppies!
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
These are real, live women?
Jealousy is so unattractive.
Yeah?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Which you pulled, hard!
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
...not the pit.
Just say it, Dad.
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
I will not have my boys arguing.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Whatever you want.
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
You want it in writing?
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
He phoned it in.
Eventually you'll let go.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
That's hard to believe.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Oh. Goodness.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Of course I like girls.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
Me? The King of Coitus?
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Take your time.
I understand.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Suzie?
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
I net a guy in a bar.
You could say that.
You have someplace to be?
Just check out the car.
We don't know that, Ray...
Ray, you heard him...
And what do they say?
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
No!
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
Yeah, but...
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Curiosity, I guess.
Police -- God -- get a life.
I miss Dad.
In back of the garage.
So you got my mom's money.
About six and a half million dollars.
Stick?
You know what it takes.
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
Hello.
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
That's not your line.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
Just like that?
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Will they?
About what?
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Sit down, Lombardo.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
That was the same thing Ray said.
Jim West.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Is this leading somewhere?
Starting with a screw?
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
I'm going to hit you.
Hey, I tried the board.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Thank you.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
I'm sure we will.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Private train?
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
He had a pressing engagement.
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Yes!
It is?
Then come with us.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
Say what?
As above, so below.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Are you okay?
I don't know.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Are you a warrior?
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
You?
I won't.
Who?
Absolutely not.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
That's all I ever wanted!
What do I need for that?
His will.
Why?
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Me neither!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Who is he?
Queen Cherlindrea?
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Yes, sir.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
No pistol. Ever.
Okay, Mr. Book.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Sure have, Sam.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
Johnny –
Move! Or you die right here!
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
We do not go into your courts.
I would not be too sure.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
No.
I was wrong.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Two days.
But you can't.
You tell him. When you're able.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
But... You may not be well enough.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
Wrong.
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
They don't have any shit.
You might have killed him!
No... No. It is just the English way.
They are English. They don't understand.
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
Do you presume to criticize the....
Who are you?
I don't believe you!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
Whenever you wish.
Why --
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Oh, no -- no!
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
What sort of an animal is that?
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
You've had plenty of time already!
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
You're right -- I am a coward.
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
Hah!
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Did they hurtcha?
I think I'll miss you most of all.
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Ohhhh --
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
To Oz?
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Oh --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
It did?
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
I -- Oh --
Fine.  He's got a plan
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
It's a whatzis?
Yeah.
Don't push!
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Yes.
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
We'll get you together!
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Oh, no!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Well, I --
You promised us real things -- a real...
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
Elektra King.
Elektra would control it all.
But what if...
I could come for a second opinion?
Who?
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I know.
I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
I think you do.
He used your exact words.
Not interested.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
A rope!
No!  Get me out!
Where?
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
How would you know?
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Washington?
Don't call me that.
Wrong answers?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
You're the only human being I care for.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
And what if you¹re wrong?
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
What do you mean, frame-up?
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
We should get back --  What?
Janey, will you marry me?
I don't know their real names.
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Am I free to go?
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Ever see one of these before?
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Yes it does.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
I'm from L.A.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
What's the deal?
Been to any good diners lately?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
... until he found tungsten.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
I don't like him being here.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
What if I like the pain?
He's busy right now.
Suit yourself.
He takes his work seriously.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
Gosh, I hope so.
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
What do you want?
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
Enough for a test.
ALIVE.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
You have the wrong house.
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Baack!
MMmmm.
I...
Yes.
Yes.
Very....very!
Darling!
Surprised!
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Will there be anything else?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
My father was a sick man.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
I wonder what's got into them?
Just putting up some tea.
What?
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Was he any good?
This guy means business.
What?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
You can say that again.
I'm not trying to be funny.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
How do you know it was a 'he'?
Can you play it?
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
That sound good, boss.
... It's.
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
What a filthy mess.
Yes!
Are you serious??
I think so.
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Why don't we talk inside?
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
MMMMmmmmm!
Do Something!  Stall them!
Food!
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
I'm explaining my reasons.
But will they make good use of them?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
Which one?
